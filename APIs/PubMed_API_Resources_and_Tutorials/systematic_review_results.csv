40974187,Exploring Multi-Omics Tools and Their Advancement to Study Drought Stress Responses.,"Climate change poses significant threats to optimal crop production, with drought emerging as a major challenge impacting food security. To meet the demands of a growing population under increasingly variable environmental conditions, it is central to comprehend plant responses to stress. Recent advancements in omics technologies have transformed our understanding of drought-responsive genes, associated networks and pathways at the genome-wide level. These tools enable comprehensive insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing drought response and help us to identify critical genes, regulatory networks, and stress response pathways. This comprehensive review explores the potential of multi-omics approaches in plant functional genomics, aiming to provide a holistic view of drought tolerance mechanisms by integrating data from diverse omics disciplines. By unravelling the complexities of gene regulation, protein dynamics, and metabolic pathways, these integrative tools offer a path toward precise crop improvement strategies. Further, we have also discussed the challenges that persist in integrating these approaches to develop high-yielding, drought-resilient crop varieties. Overall, this article addresses the challenges of utilizing a multi-omics strategy to accelerate targeted crop improvement for drought stress response, and how this approach can help ensure global food security.",2025,Kaberi Sonowal; Sonal Sharma; Gokul Anil Kumar; Vaishali Gupta; Gulshan Kumar; Prafull Salvi,Physiologia plantarum
40974145,"Selenium-Containing Peptides from Foodstuff: Preparation, Bioavailability, Bioactivities, and Future Perspectives.","Selenium-containing peptides (SePPs) are bioactive compounds with dual nutritional and functional properties, playing key roles in antioxidant defense and immunomodulation. However, selenium (Se)'s narrow therapeutic window limits clinical use, whereas SePPs, incorporating Se elements, offer higher bioavailability and multifunctional benefits. Research indicates that SePPs demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional Se supplements regarding intestinal absorption efficiency, free radical scavenging capacity, and targeted delivery. Recent advances in preparation techniques, including enzymatic hydrolysis, selenization modification, and microbial fermentation, have enabled promising applications of SePPs in hepatoprotection, antioxidative stress, immunomodulation, and antihypertensive treatments. However, industrial production remains constrained by limitations in efficiency, stability, and purity, while the mechanisms of bioavailability and long-term safety require further investigation. This review systematically examines preparation, bioavailability, bioactivities, and applications of SePPs in food and medicine, proposing innovative strategies like nanocarrier delivery and genetic engineering to advance functional foods and precision medicine for Se-related diseases.",2025,Lingyun Gu; Wenzhu Zhao; Jucheng Hu; Mok Wen Jye; Zhipeng Yu,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
40974075,The utility of artificial intelligence in the management of dengue fever: a perspective on future directions.,"Dengue fever remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. With millions affected each year and the increasing prevalence of the disease due to urbanisation and climate change, effective management strategies are crucial. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents transformative possibilities for the management of dengue fever. AI-driven systems can improve disease surveillance by analyzing extensive volumes of epidemiological, environmental, and socio-behavioral data to identify early warning indicators and forecast outbreak trends. Enhanced diagnostic instruments driven by AI algorithms can expedite and refine case identification, especially in resource-constrained environments. Moreover, AI can enhance targeted vector control tactics by pinpointing high-risk areas and optimizing the implementation of preventive measures. AI can optimize resource allocation in healthcare institutions. These applications have the potential to substantially alleviate the burden of dengue fever, enhance patient outcomes, and fortify health system resilience. As AI technologies progress, their influence in public health is expected to grow, facilitating creative, data-driven strategies that correspond with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to enhance global health equity and disease prevention. Continued research, collaboration, and community engagement will be crucial to realising the full potential of AI in addressing this pressing public health challenge.",2025,Mohammed Hussein; Elshimaa Ali; Yassin Kamal; Ali Elhouni; E L Mardi Ems; Yousif Eltayeb; Ali Awadallah Saeed; Ahmed Hassan Fahal,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene
40974058,Complex effects of climatic variation on bumblebee queen fitness.,"Climate change is a global biodiversity threat. To understand how a changing climate affects individual fitness and gain insights into which mechanisms are responsible, we need to establish how climatic variation affects individual life-history traits (e.g. growth, survival and reproduction). Long-term data linking insect life histories and climate parameters are therefore valuable but, unfortunately, rare. Here, we test how climatic variation affects health, survival and reproduction in a key European pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We relate climatic variation experienced by developing queens in the field, caught between 2000 and 2014, to fitness traits assayed in these queens under otherwise constant lab conditions. We show that wet years consistently reduce queen fitness, while warm temperatures have positive and negative impacts. Behind these annual effects lies strong seasonality. In particular, climatic conditions experienced by young queens as they forage, mate and enter hibernation are vital determinants of whether they reproduce the following spring. Results suggest that climatic drivers that reduce queen resource acquisition prior to hibernation, or accelerate resource loss over winter, are especially detrimental to spring queen fitness. This suggests a strategy to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on bumblebees: ensuring high-quality forage late in summer before queens enter diapause.",2025,Ruth Archer; Paul Schmid-Hempel; Regula Schmid-Hempel; Lena Wilfert,The Journal of animal ecology
40974010,Genome-Scale Metabolic Models in Plant Stress Physiology: Implications for Future Climate Resilience.,"Global climate change will result in plants being subjected to abiotic stresses with greater frequency and intensity. Such stresses necessarily impact the metabolic network, both in terms of its structure and fluxes. The construction and analysis of Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs) has proved to be a useful tool for both the prediction of the effects of climate change on metabolism and identification of targets for breeding increased resilience. In this review, we first explain how such GEMs are constructed and how fluxes can be predicted, providing a detailed account of how models can be developed to capture metabolic variations across both space and time. Whilst a growing field, the number of plant GEMs is lower than that of other taxa, and here we discuss the reasons behind this disparity and propose solutions. We then highlight studies that have investigated the effects of changing CO2 concentrations, drought and high temperature on metabolism, making use of innovations in the construction of context specific and multi-organ models. CAM and C4 are also discussed as types of photosynthesis that are typically associated with tolerance of high temperatures and low water availability. Overall, we aim to demonstrate that plant GEMs can be a useful addition to the physiologist's toolkit and can generate important insights and testable hypotheses regarding plant responses to stress.",2025,Érica Mangaravite; Christina Cleo Vinson; Eduardo Luís Menezes de Almeida; Thomas Christopher Rhys Williams,Plant physiology
40973995,Underexplored Microbiota of Testate Amoeba in Southeast Asian Ecosystems: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Single-celled protists, such as testate amoebae, have garnered significant attention as potential bioindicators which translate into their recognition of being ecologically sensitive. They are known for their use in ecological and paleoecological studies, yet their diversity and distribution remain poorly documented in blind spot regions of the Paleotropics. This study systematically consolidates all published species records of testate amoebae, evaluates spatial research bias, and assesses regional richness from Southeast Asian countries. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across digital databases and web-based repositories. In total, there are 497 testate amoebae belonging to 70 genera, including infra-specific species from the 46 studies scoped in this review. Species richness curves revealed steep trajectories in under sampled countries, indicating untapped diversity. Despite geographical proximity, the seeming overlap of species per country was limited, pointing toward predominance of species turnover than nested clustering of richness. This disjunct pattern in species composition suggests the influence of potential ecological specialization or, perhaps, a mere result of uneven research effort in the unexplored regions. The research for testate amoebae has been in a progressive state, yet strong emphasis needs addressing species exploration in response to intensified climate change and degradation of habitats as these would mean potential biodiversity loss.",2025,Christon Jairus M Racoma; Leila L Tomacas; Nikki Heherson A Dagamac; Yonas Isaak Tekle,The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology
40973973,Well-being of persons preparing extensive health and social services reform.,"An extensive health and social services reform was implemented in Finland at the beginning of 2023. To describe the working conditions and well-being of persons preparing extensive organizational changes, to compare their results to the reference group, to analyse whether unreasonable workload impacted work recovery, psychosocial distress, work ability and work performance, and to analyse whether the changes in work recovery, psychosocial distress and work ability were associated with a change in work performance. Data were collected by four surveys from reform preparers in 2022 in open cohort settings. Descriptive statistics were used to report the preparers' situation and in relation to the reference group at the endpoint. Further, covariance and linear regression analyses were performed to study the associations between start and endpoint data (N = 340). While putting in significant effort, decreasing proportions of preparers experienced leader support, participatory safety and opportunities for innovation. Many preparers had unreasonable workload, a significant proportion working long hours and doing preparation work alongside their main responsibilities. Their situation was notably worse on various work-related indicators compared to the reference group. Unreasonable workload and adverse changes in working conditions decreased the well-being of many preparers, impacting their work performance. When preparing for extensive organizational changes, the focus should be on leading preparers' collaboration and work processes. Leadership should support innovation, foster a positive team climate, ensure participatory safety and provide a reasonable workload to support well-being. Good working conditions are important as they promote better well-being, work ability and performance.",2025,J Laitinen; K Selander; H Lahti; K Reuna; R Nikunlaakso,"Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)"
40973808,Meta-analysis shows that planting nitrogen-fixing species increases soil organic carbon stock.,"Nitrogen (N)-fixing species are widely used in forestation and agriculture. The effects of planting N-fixing species on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, however, remain uncertain, limiting policy development and their application towards a possible climate change mitigation strategy. Here we conduct a global meta-analysis of 385 datapoints from 136 studies comparing SOC stock with planting N-fixing versus non-N-fixing species. Planting N-fixing species increases SOC stock by 16% compared with non-N-fixing species. This SOC increase is closely accompanied by soil N increases, with an average accumulation of 7.8 g of SOC per gram of soil N increase. Climate mediates SOC responses, with greater SOC sequestration observed in drier and warmer regions, particularly in the tropics. We estimate that an additional increase of 0.29-0.75 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup> in global SOC stock could be achieved by adopting N-fixing species for forestation, agriculture and regeneration of marginal lands, highlighting their potential for climate change mitigation.",2025,Xibin Sun; Ji Chen; Yakov Kuzyakov; Yi Yang; Gabriel W D Ferreira; Raúl Ochoa-Hueso; Carsten W Mueller; Zhenchuan Wang; Yixue Hong; Dejun Li; Hao Chen,Nature ecology & evolution
40973791,A dominant subgroup of marine Bathyarchaeia assimilates organic and inorganic carbon into unconventional membrane lipids.,"Bathyarchaeia, an abundant and ecologically versatile archaea found commonly in marine sediments, has a key role in the global carbon cycle. However, its lipid biomarkers and carbon assimilation mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using a highly enriched Bathyarchaeia culture (>95% archaea) obtained from estuarine sediment of the East China Sea, we show that Baizosediminiarchaeum (formerly subgroup Bathy-8), the most abundant and widespread Bathyarchaeia group on Earth, synthesizes butanetriol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (BDGTs) as its dominant membrane lipids. BDGTs are unusual archaeal tetraether lipids characterized by a butanetriol backbone instead of the typical glycerol, challenging fundamental assumptions in archaeal lipid biochemistry. Although BDGTs have been previously identified in the methanogen Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, we now provide direct evidence that Bathyarchaeia also synthesizes BDGTs, definitively establishing this globally abundant group as a natural BDGT producer. Stable isotope probing with <sup>13</sup>C-bicarbonate shows that Baizosediminiarchaeum assimilates carbon into BDGTs from both inorganic carbon and lignin. These unique carbon assimilation strategies suggest the biogeochemical importance of Baizosediminarchaeum in marine carbon cycling and organic matter decomposition.",2025,Liang Dong; Yunge Jing; Jialin Hou; Jiaming Zhou; Tiantian Yu; Shijie Chen; Lewen Liang; Pengfei Zhu; Xiaoxiao Zhao; Kai-Uwe Hinrichs; Fengping Wang,Nature microbiology
40973683,Members of the lichen photobiont genus Trebouxia show species-specific photo-physiological and transcriptome-level responses to high light.,"Members of the common lichen photobiont Trebouxia occur in all terrestrial habitats, from the arctic to the tropics, however, the mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance in Trebouxia are little understood. Currently, lineages belonging to this genus are grouped into clades A, C, I, S, D. Here we study six species, which belong to the S-Clade and A-Clade of Trebouxia, and were isolated from the lichen-forming fungi Umbilicaria pustulata and U. phaea. Three of the Trebouxia species have a climatic niche preference at low elevation (Mediterranean climate), two at high elevation (cold temperate climate), and one is found in both climate zones. These species have demonstrated extensive genomic divergence, particularly in genome regions associated with photosynthesis. Therefore, we hypothesize that they will exhibit differential performance under varying light conditions. We assessed physiological and transcriptomic responses to high light (HL) (control: 60 µmol photons/m2/s; HL:150 µmol photons/m2/s) using a controlled environmental chamber. We examined the cultures´ responses after 1 hour and 3 days (12 hours per day) of HL exposure. We measured photo-physiological parameters including maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in combination with differential gene expression analysis via RNASeq. Average levels of Fv/Fm and NPQ showed significant reduction following HL exposure, however, this varied among species. Species from high elevation (i.e. Trebouxia S12 C0006 and A10 C0009) exhibited relatively high NPQ capacity throughout the experiment. There was no significant change in average chl a concentration. Further, only a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found for specific species following exposure to 1 hour HL, including those associated with chloroplast thylakoid membrane, transposon TX1 and photorespiration. On the other hand, there are more DEGs found for all Trebouxia species exposed to prolonged HL, which involved genes associated to DNA biosynthetic process, cell cycle and cell wall organization. Photoprotection-associated genes related to NPQ, photosystem II repair, oxygen evolving assembly and biosynthesis of photoprotective pigments (carotenoid and chl) also showed differential expression due to prolonged HL. Overall, our findings show that in Trebouxia the capacity to withstand high light conditions is highly species-specific, and not driven by phylogenetic relatedness, or climatic niche preference. We do not observe parallel patterns in species preferring similar climatic niches, with the exception of species from high elevation (Trebouxia S12 C0006 and A10 C0009), which exhibit generally high NPQ capacity.",2025,Rosa Celia Poquita-Du; Jürgen Otte; Nicolas Herrmann; Claudia Büchel; Imke Schmitt,Journal of experimental botany
40973657,Leaf water storage determines foliar water uptake capacity along the isohydric-anisohydric continuum.,"Foliar water uptake (FWU) capacity of more anisohydric species is significantly higher than that of relatively isohydric species, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. While leaf nutrient elements may modulate the FWU process, this relationship remains understudied. In this study, we investigated four typical species from the arid region of northwest China and measured their FWU parameters along with various associated traits. The results showed obvious differences in FWU capacity and traits along the isohydric-anisohydric continuum, with more anisohydric species exhibiting higher FWU capacity. Structural equation modeling revealed that leaf water storage structures were the primary factor contributing to the high FWU capacity in more anisohydric species (total effect = 0.25), followed by epidermal traits (total effect = 0.18). Leaf phosphorus affected FWU indirectly via leaf water storage structures (standardized path coefficient = 0.35). This study reveals key drivers and mechanisms underlying the FWU capacity of more anisohydric species, providing a theoretical framework for plant water use strategies in arid environments. It also helps to predict the water adaptation strategies of different plant functional types under future climate change scenarios.",2025,Hui-Min Wang; Zhou-Kang Li; Guang-Hui Lv; Ming-Shan Xu; Xiao-Dong Yang,Tree physiology
40973611,InDel variation and contraction of the C-repeat binding factor family contribute to cold sensitivity in Betula fujianensis.,"Betula species exhibit exceptional cold tolerance, yet the evolutionary drivers of their cold adaptation remain unclear. Betula fujianensis, a subtropical member of this genus, is an ideal model to investigate the evolution of cold adaptation. Here, we present a nearly telomere-to-telomere genome assembly and identify a ten-fold reduction in nucleotide diversity in the extant B. fujianensis population compared to its temperate relatives (B. pendula and B. platyphylla). This decrease in nucleotide diversity was driven by two historical population declines during global cooling periods. B. fujianensis exhibits heightened sensitivity to low temperatures, associated with a contracted C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene family and a 185-bp insertion in the DREB and EAR motif protein 1 (DEAR1) promoter, which enhances its expression. We demonstrate that DEAR1 is a negative regulator of CBF expression in a negative feedback loop. Collectively, our results identify the DEAR1-CBF interplay as an important regulatory module for cold adaptation. Our findings shed light on plant cold adaptation mechanisms and provide critical genomic resources to guide conservation strategies for this climate-vulnerable species under global climate change.",2025,Hebi Zhuang; Erpei Lin; Jianbo Xie; Mei Jiang; Fei Ni; Shuaibin Shi; Meng Liu; Siyu Miao; Ming Wei; Chenghao Li; Jiming Liu; Xiaojuan Liu; Xian-Ge Hu; Wenwu Wu; Jarkko Salojärvi; Huahong Huang,The Plant cell

40973377,"Evaluating the health and well-being effects of increasing biodiversity within multiple small parks in Edinburgh, UK: a protocol for a mixed-methods, longitudinal, pre-post natural experiment.","Recent legislation in the UK regarding requirements for new developments to increase biodiversity may have significant implications for the environment and population health. Despite this, relatively little is known regarding the health and social benefits of increasing biodiversity in densely populated urban areas. This protocol outlines plans for a mixed-method, longitudinal, natural experiment study which will evaluate the planned, biodiversity-focused redevelopment of six small urban parks in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK). Using systematic observation (at baseline, 1 month post-intervention and 1 year post-baseline) and a longitudinal household survey (at baseline and 1 year post-baseline), the primary outcomes of personal well-being, and secondary outcomes of nature connectedness and park usage behaviours, will be assessed, respectively. Consent for data linkage of respondent's health records will also be sought. Process evaluation will employ semi-structured, qualitative interviews with stakeholders and walk-along interviews with local residents in order to understand implementation processes. Space-related well-being will also be assessed using citizen science approaches. This study was approved by the University of Edinburgh's School of Health in Social Sciences ethics committee. This study will provide further evidence for policymakers, the public and researchers of the health and social well-being effects of urban biodiversity interventions. Study findings will be disseminated via public forums such as community workshops and through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at scientific conferences.",2025,Stephen Malden; Craig W McDougall; Catharine Ward Thompson; Charlotte Wendelboe-Nelson; Antonio Ross-Perez; Tom Clemens; Sammy Mason; Roberto Villegas-Diaz; Alexandra Hoadley; Alex Hunter; Ruth Jepson; Andrew J Williams,BMJ open
40973271,Hydrophobic surface modified calcium alginate fibers for preparing flame retardant and comfortable Janus fabrics.,"With the increasing violent fluctuations in temperature and humidity, alongside rising fire risks triggered by global climate change, the development of multifunctional textile materials that integrate both humidity regulation and flame-retardant protection has become crucial for ensuring human health and safety. In this paper, the hydrophobic modification of calcium alginate (CA) fibers was successfully carried out by wet spinning technology combined with an impregnation modification process. After surface modification with fluorocarbon (FC) resin, the WCA of CA-FC fibers was increased from 32 ± 0.5° to 120.5 ± 1°, achieving a successful transition of natural polysaccharide fibers from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the inherent flame-retardant properties of FC resin synergistically enhanced the flame-retardant performance of CA fibers. Leveraging the wettability gradient, a multifunctional protective fabric with both unidirectional water conductivity and flame retardancy was developed by compounding hydrophobically modified CA-FC fibers with unmodified CA fibers. The wettability gradient between the hydrophilic CA side and hydrophobic FC side provided a robust driving force for moisture transport, enabling the Janus-CA-FC (JCF) fabrics to achieve rapid unidirectional water transport while maintaining excellent flame-retardant performance. This study lays the foundation for the development of multifunctional protective fabrics with flame retardancy and humidity management based on natural polysaccharide materials.",2025,Yue Ma; Zihan Wu; Meijie Qu; Ru Chen; Jing Guo; Yuezhen Bin,Carbohydrate polymers
40973193,Sustainable Water Footprint Management in Agriculture: A Review of Linear Programming-Based Models and Future Directions.,"The sustainable management of water resources in agriculture is a global imperative as climate change, population growth, and competing demands increasingly strain freshwater systems. This review systematically analyzes 58 peer-reviewed studies that utilize linear programming (LP) and its advanced variants to optimize agricultural water use, with a specific emphasis on improving water footprint (WF) efficiency. Applications are categorized into three core domains: crop allocation and land use, irrigation scheduling, and economic optimization. The findings reveal that while LP continues to dominate, alternative models-such as mixed-integer programming (MILP), weighted and fuzzy goal programming (WGP, FGP), and fractional programming-are gaining traction for their ability to address real-world complexities and multi-objective decision environments. However, critical gaps remain, particularly in the integration of WF indicators, climate variability, and socio-economic dynamics. This review not only maps the existing optimization landscape but also proposes a forward-looking research agenda. Key directions include the development of hybrid models, the explicit incorporation of WF metrics into objective functions, and the integration of decision-support systems for policy and farm-level planning. WF-aware optimization is thus positioned not merely as a technical instrument, but as a transformative tool for advancing agricultural sustainability-enhancing resilience, equity, and ecological stewardship in water-scarce regions and beyond.",2025,Amjad Mizyed,Integrated environmental assessment and management
40973152,Methanol to Polypropylene: Life Cycle Assessment and a Preliminary Social Impact Analysis.,"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) are currently essential tools for evaluating the sustainability of products and industrial systems. While LCA is systematically applied today and is considered a stable methodology, supported by material-specific guidelines and rich databases, S-LCA remains immature in certain aspects. In the presented case study, LCA was applied to compare 11 methanol synthesis processes, all based on reverse Water-Gas Shift, but characterised by different sources of CO2 and H2 supply, to identify the most promising. Accordingly, the model was then integrated with that of propylene production (methanol to propylene-MtP), identified as a molecule of interest for the current and future market. Then, the authors propose an innovative approach to enhance the application of S-LCA in the industrial chemistry sector. The climate change impact of the different methanol production scenarios varies significantly: the most impactful is the methanol synthesis via coal gasification (2.76 kg CO2 eq), while the most promising are via CO2 generated by wood chips waste or dedicated biomass by employing hydrogen produce with wind electrolysis which show the negative impacts of -0.40 kg CO2 eq thanks to cogeneration and the use of hydrogen from renewable sources. On the social level, the database shows a preference for productions occurring in Europe, across all the categories analyzed. The proposal of a sector-specific guideline represents a step forward that could facilitate the future application of the methodology. Moreover, the integration of LCA and S-LCA proves effective in delivering a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the issues addressed, offering valuable insights for stakeholders. The LCA should be applied to assess the environmental sustainability of alternative production routes in chemical processes, while the complexity of Social-LCA can be mitigated by initiating preliminary assessments.",2025,Alice Vardaro; Francesco Arfelli; Fabrizio Passarini; Daniele Cespi,Integrated environmental assessment and management
40973063,"Development of genetic tools for the sea anemone Aiptasia, a model system for coral biology.","The reef-building corals can thrive in nutrient-poor waters because of the mutualistic symbiosis between the animal hosts and their photosynthetic dinoflagellate endosymbionts. This symbiosis is threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, so that a deeper mechanistic understanding of its function is not only of great basic biological interest but also crucial for developing rational approaches to coral conservation. The small sea anemone Aiptasia is an attractive model system for studies of this symbiosis but has been limited to date by a lack of effective genetic methods. Here, we describe the use of a simple electroporation protocol to introduce various genetic constructs [plasmid DNAs, mRNAs, and short-hairpin (sh) RNAs] into Aiptasia zygotes. Plasmid-based expression of reporter constructs in the resulting larvae was highly mosaic. In contrast, electroporation of mRNAs into zygotes resulted in uniform expression within the larvae, and success rates were similar when single or multiple mRNAs were introduced. The shRNAs were effective in knocking down expression of both co-electroporated mRNAs and endogenous genes. In this way, we could confirm the previously reported role of BRACHYURY in cnidarian embryonic development. In addition, we could show that knockdown of an Aiptasia homologue of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) interfered with larval uptake and/or retention of a symbiosis-compatible algal strain. The ability to use Aiptasia larvae for such reverse-genetic studies should greatly enhance the power of this model system and serve as a starting point for further development of genetic tools in Aiptasia and other cnidarians.",2025,Christian Renicke; Natalie Swinhoe; Catherine Henderson; Emily Meier; Lorraine Ling; Geraldine L Keat; Shumpei Maruyama; Maitri Rangarajan-Paul; John R Pringle; Phillip A Cleves,Genetics
40972701,Cascading Tipping Points of Mercury Dynamics in Coastal Sediments: Anthropogenic-Enhanced Deposition vs. Warming-Driven Remobilization.,"Coastal sediments in rapidly urbanizing semi-enclosed bays act as critical yet vulnerable mercury (Hg) reservoirs, where converging anthropogenic and climatic pressures are pushing the Hg held within towards a critical tipping point, consequently threatening public and ecosystem health. This study deciphers the two-decadal sediment Hg dynamics in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB, Yellow Sea) through field sampling and historical data analysis (2002-2021), revealing that surficial sediment Hg in eastern nearshore hotspots decreased significantly between 2002 and 2018 (p < 0.05), followed by a rebound at a rate of 23 ± 5 ng/g/yr post-2018 (p < 0.05). Urbanization Impact Factor (UIF) and Hg/total organic carbon (TOC) ratios identified high-intensity urbanization as the primary enrichment driver, modulated by selenium (Se), organic matter (OM), redox conditions, and salinity. Crucially, nearshore Hg exhibited temperature sensitivity, negatively correlated with seasonal warming (winter: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94, p < 0.05; spring: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p < 0.001)-potentially reflecting a climate feedback that enhances legacy Hg remobilization. Projections that combine post-2018 accumulation rates with the negative thermal feedback suggest that, under human-climate pressures, nearshore ""new Hg"" could reach levels approximately one order of magnitude higher than those at present by 2100. Monte Carlo simulations predicted moderate contamination (I<sub>geo</sub>) risk under extreme scenarios. This dual forcing mechanism-urbanization-driven sequestration versus climate-triggered re-release-highlights the need for integrated management strategies to prevent coastal sediment Hg from approaching cascading tipping points.",2025,Xiangyu Kong; Jing Zhang; Qian Liu; Yanbin Li; Qian He,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)"
40972622,"Associations of ambient exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene with daily mortality: a multicountry time-series study in 757 global locations.","The presence of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEX) in the environment is of increasing concern due to their toxicity and ubiquity. Although the adverse health effects of BTEX exposure have been documented, robust epidemiological evidence from large-scale, multicountry studies using advanced exposure assessment methodologies remains scarce. We aimed to assess the association of short-term ambient exposure to individual BTEX components and their mixture with daily total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality on a global scale. Daily data on mortality, meteorological factors, and air pollution were collected from 757 locations across 46 countries or regions. Data on individual chemicals (ie, benzene, toluene, xylenes [summation of ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and o-xylene]) and the aggregate mixture (ie, BTEX) were estimated using a chemistry-climate model. We examined the short-term associations of each individual chemical as well as the BTEX mixture with daily total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in a multicountry framework. Using a two-stage time-series design, we first applied generalised additive models with a quasi-Poisson distribution to obtain location-specific associations, which were subsequently pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Two-pollutant models were used to assess the independent effects of BTEX after adjusting for co-pollutants (PM<sub>2·5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide). Additionally, we assessed the overall exposure-response curves with spline terms. An IQR increment of BTEX concentration on lag 0-2 days (3-day moving average of the present day and the previous 2 days) was associated with increases of 0·57% (95% CI 0·49-0·65), 0·42% (0·30-0·54), and 0·68% (0·50-0·86) in total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. The corresponding effect estimates for an IQR increment in individual chemicals (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) were 0·38-0·61%, 0·44-0·70%, and 0·41-0·65%, respectively. The associations remained significant after adjusting for co-pollutants, with a general decline in magnitude, except for a slight increase after adjustment for ozone. The shape of the exposure-response curves for all pollutants and causes of death was almost linear, with steeper slopes at low concentrations and no discernible thresholds. This global study provides novel evidence linking short-term exposure to ambient BTEX, both individually and as a mixture, with increased daily total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive air pollution mitigation policies, including stringent controls on BTEX emissions, to protect public health.

American Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) support important fisheries across the United States and can experience angling and release across a range of temperatures due to current management regulations. Currently, the impact of thermal variation on paddlefish has not been defined, precluding managers from making thermally-informed decisions related to the timing and duration of angling and harvest seasons. Therefore, we quantified the response of paddlefish chased to exhaustion and air-exposed across a range of temperatures. To accomplish this, juvenile paddlefish were acclimated to 13, 17.5, and 22 °C. Fish were then subjected to a simulated angling interaction and allowed to recover for 0.5 h, 4 h, or 8 h to evaluate recovery of physiological parameters. Following exercise, recovery profiles differed among acclimation temperatures, with paddlefish acclimated to the warmest temperature (22 °C) having prolonged recovery of plasma lactate, compared to fish experiencing cooler temperatures (13.0 °C and 17.5 °C). A second group of paddlefish from each temperature was subjected to a critical thermal maximum test (CT<sub>max</sub>). Paddlefish CT<sub>max</sub> was influenced by acclimation temperature, but experienced an upper thermal limit, with fish gaining a small but non-significant increase in thermal tolerance when acclimated to temperatures above 17.5 °C. Together, results indicate that paddlefish experiencing warmer water temperatures have reduced performance relative to cooler fish, suggesting that angling or release at temperatures over 17.5 °C will result in an extended recovery period, and paddlefish may have limited capacity for acclimation to warmer temperatures.",2025,Shasta R Kamara; Jackson C Glomb; Cory D Suski,Journal of thermal biology
40972450,SpCas9-mediated gene editing in bovine embryo via single adeno-associated virus infection using a novel micro-sized promoter.,"Genome editing in livestock offers practical solutions to address challenges related to land use, climate change, and food production. However, conventional delivery methods such as electroporation and microinjection impose physical stress on embryos, limiting scalability. This study aimed to develop a simplified, non-invasive, and scalable genome editing system for bovine embryos by designing an all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. A novel micro-sized promoter (50 bp), derived from the core regulatory region upstream of the bovine MSTN gene, was constructed to enable expression of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (spCas9) within the AAV packaging limit (∼4.7 kb). This promoter was incorporated into an AAV cassette containing spCas9, a polyadenylation signal, a U6 promoter, and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the bovine ALB gene. After confirming editing activity in bovine fibroblasts, the AAV6 vector was added directly to in vitro fertilization (IVF) cultures without physical manipulation. Genome editing was successfully induced, with insertion/deletion (indel) mutations detected in 33.8 ± 23.2 % of the blastocysts. Although blastocyst development was moderately reduced, gene editing was achieved without invasive techniques. These results demonstrate that a micro-promoter-based AAV system can support spCas9-mediated genome editing in bovine embryos through a single-vector infection strategy. The system presents a promising platform for producing gene-edited livestock and may contribute to more efficient and less labor-intensive applications in animal biotechnology.",2025,Kyeong-Hyeon Eom; Soo-Young Yum; Gyeong-Min Gim; Young-Chai Kim; Byeongho Moon; Goo Jang,Theriogenology
40972417,"Hot and cold, safe and unsafe: Evaluating the impact of extreme temperatures on work-related accidents in China.","We investigate how extreme temperatures impact work-related accidents across 411 cities in China from 2015 to 2019. Using a linear probability model, we find a significant causal link between rising temperatures and workplace accidents, with a 10°C increase leading to a 0.09 % rise in accident probability. Our analysis shows that temperatures over 24-26°C markedly increase accident risk, particularly in outdoor-intensive industries like construction and public facility management, with southern regions facing higher hazards due to prolonged heat exposure. Robustness checks, including lagged and lead temperature effects, confirm the consistency of our findings, reinforcing the direct link between environmental conditions and accident occurrence. This research contributes a comprehensive, causal view of temperature's effect on workplace safety in a developing context, emphasizing the urgent need for temperature-sensitive safety protocols. For developing countries such as China, climate-resilient labor policies, including adaptive work schedules, cooling breaks, and shaded workspaces, are critical to protect workers and sustain productivity as global temperatures rise. Our findings lay a foundation for policy actions aimed at bolstering occupational safety standards to address escalating climate risks.",2025,Zhenyu Yao; Xiang Cao,Economics and human biology
40972331,"Integrated approaches for managing soil salinization: Detection, mitigation, and sustainability.","Soil salinization poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity and ecological health, exacerbated by climate change and improper land management. Addressing this issue necessitates monitoring and mitigation strategies. However, the limitations of small-scale studies highlight the need for larger-scale research. The integration of satellite, drone, and remote sensing technologies with geographic information systems provides an approach for monitoring and assessing salinity across extensive areas. Furthermore, coupling these technologies with machine learning algorithms enables dynamic monitoring and predictive modeling of soil salinization trends. Salinity stress negatively impacts plant growth, photosynthesis, and nutrient acquisition, leading to reduced crop yields. Mitigation strategies include the application of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) and optimized irrigation practices, such as deficit drip irrigation (DDI) with saline water (SW) and alternate fresh/saline water irrigation, which are essential for enhancing yields under saline conditions. Nevertheless, SW irrigation requires careful management to prevent salt accumulation. These practices enhance yield stability while minimizing salt accumulation. Soil remediation strategies, including improved drainage systems, chemical amendments, phytoremediation using salt-tolerant plants or halophytes, and the development of salt-tolerant crop varieties through genetic engineering, are crucial for managing saline-alkali soils. This review demonstrates that an integrated approach combining advanced detection technologies, optimized agricultural management (fertilization and irrigation), and comprehensive remediation techniques can significantly mitigate the impacts of soil salinization, improve soil health, and sustain agricultural productivity in affected regions.",2025,Yu Chen; Wen-Yao Zhang; Mian Wang; Jian-Hua Zhang; Mo-Xian Chen; Fu-Yuan Zhu; Tao Song,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB
40972325,Molecular characteristics of gonadal differentiation dimorphism in the ovoviviparous fish Sebastes schlegelii under gradient high-temperature induction.,"Global warming can alter fish sex ratios and threaten population stability, particularly in species with temperature-sensitive sex differentiation. Sebastes schlegelii, an ovoviviparous species adapted to both cold and warm waters, may exhibit feminization or masculinization under high temperatures. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that high-temperature exposure activates distinct sex-differentiation pathways and sought to identify the key genes and metabolites involved. Our findings reveal a balanced sex ratio at 18 °C, a notable feminization at 24 °C with 83.3 % of individuals being female, and a significant masculinization at 27 °C where 76.7 % are male. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed at 24 °C, pathways related to steroid hormone biosynthesis, estrogen signaling, and progesterone, androgen, and estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists were activated, whereas at 27 °C, activation was prominent in steroid hormone biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and cholesterol metabolism. Key genes and metabolites included cyp7a1, cyp1a1, hsd17b1, hsd17b2, erα, creb1, hsp70, and Estrone at 24 °C, and cyp7a1, lipa, lss, and Taurocholic acid at 27 °C. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed upregulation of female differentiation genes (foxl2, cyp19a1) at 24 °C and male differentiation genes (sox9, amh, dmrt1, hsd11b2) at 27 °C. Hormonal assays showed elevated 17β-estradiol (E2) at 24 °C and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) at 27 °C. In situ hybridization (ISH) revealed that, in stage II gonads, sox9 and amh are predominantly localized in Sertoli cells of the testis. These findings support our hypothesis and demonstrate that high temperature drives sex differentiation in S. schlegelii through distinct molecular programs, identifying core regulators and pathways underlying temperature-sensitive sexual development.",2025,Jinwei Huang; Yongshuang Xiao; Zongcheng Song; Jun Li,Marine pollution bulletin
40972299,Data-driven optimization of county-scale straw management for low-carbon and income-enhancing rice production in China.,"Returning straw to soil after harvest is not a simple binary decision for agricultural stakeholders. Optimizing straw management under site-specific conditions is crucial to balance the trade-off between climatic changes mitigation and food security in rice production. Here, we developed an integrated framework to determine the optimal ratios of straw return and removal across major rice-cropping regions in China. Using machine learning (ML) models, we identified site-specific straw return ratios that minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without compromising rice yield. Additionally, a complementary straw logistics model was proposed to manage excess straw instead of burning. Among five ML models evaluated, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in predicting the impact of straw return on CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, soil organic carbon sequestration rate and rice yield. In single rice systems, a high straw return rate of 73 % resulted in an average yield increases of 26.5 % and a net reduction in GHG emissions by 105 %. In contrast, our model recommends prioritizing straw removal in double rice systems due to difficulties in balancing yield-emission trade-offs. The net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) analysis revealed that economic gains from increased yields and reduced nitrogen fertilizer use outweighed the costs of straw collection and off-field transportation. Notably, the current social cost of carbon contributed minimally to total economic benefits, despite substantial GHG mitigation benefits realized through ML-guided strategies. Overall, this study highlights the potential of site-specific, data-driven straw management to promote sustainable agricultural development in China.",2025,Qianying Wu; Shangkun Liu; Ruitao Lou; Zhiming Qi; Rongnian Tang; Qianjing Jiang; Yong He,Journal of environmental management
40972296,Climate adaptation in the Colorado Plateau region: Insights from natural resource practitioners on adaptation planning and current challenges.,"Climate adaptation has been interpreted and applied in various ways within natural resource management. Previous research has not fully addressed how these different interpretations by individuals and agencies affect adaptation planning and efforts. Our study aims to address these challenges by investigating barriers to defining and interpreting adaptation comprehensively, utilizing the conceptual foundation of transformative adaptation. We used a mixed-methods research approach involving semi-structured interviews and a survey. The research participants were natural resource practitioners working on the public lands on the Colorado Plateau in the Southwestern U.S. Results showed that current land management strategies utilized by federal and state agencies pose challenges for adopting effective climate adaptation actions, and the concept of adaptation is applied and utilized in diverse ways that are not always beneficial to ecological adaptation. Our analysis indicates that current federal policies and pre-existing management priorities are central barriers to proactive adaptation in the region, where novel approaches were limited in favor of business-as-usual practices. Our study builds on existing literature that shows a present gap in natural resource planning and action on the ground due to barriers to defining adaptation, as well as how adaptation is often used to conduct business-as-usual strategies instead of taking proactive actions.",2025,Anna Lynn Vaughn; Brian Petersen,Journal of environmental management
40972211,Valve gaping behavior of bivalves under compound marine heatwaves and acidification extremes.,"Rapid increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have led to more frequent and severe extreme weather events, such as marine heatwaves (MHWs) and ocean acidity extremes (OAXs), which can devastate marine ecosystems and cause significant socioeconomic impacts. Infaunal bivalves are crucial for benthic-pelagic coupling in marine ecosystems, yet their responses to extreme weather events are poorly understood. In this study, we employed high-frequency, non-invasive valvometry to investigate how Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) behave in response to MHWs and OAXs. Long-term, real-time monitoring showed that initial exposure to MHWs notably reduced valve-gaping activity, though these effects diminished with repeated exposure. OAXs alone significantly impacted the proportion of open valves, but when combined with MHWs, they had a more pronounced effect on individual valve-gaping activity. These results suggest that Manila clam behavior is sensitive to both MHWs and OAXs, particularly when occurring together, highlighting the potential for developing an early-warning system based on valvometry.",2025,Yang Xu; Xin Luo; Yu He; Xiaoning Zang; Weiguo Lin; Yong Liu; Liqiang Zhao,Marine environmental research
40972210,"Reef geomorphology, hydrodynamic energy and coral morphology influence recovery after bleaching.","As climate change intensifies, mass coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent and severe, driving global reef decline. Post-bleaching outcomes vary widely across reef systems and individual colonies, complicating conservation efforts. Few studies integrate physical factors (site-specific geomorphology, hydrodynamics) with biological ones (coral physiology) to understand their interactions and combined effects on coral recovery. This study examines how local environmental conditions and coral traits influence post-bleaching outcomes at One Tree Reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, following the extreme 2024 heatwave. Surveys were conducted during and after the bleaching event across three geomorphically distinct sites with varying hydrodynamics. To assess coral response, 462 colonies were tagged and monitored over nine months post heat-stress. Coral responses were compared between two morphotypes - simple and complex - based on how they interact with water flow. Results show that geomorphology and water flow modulate seawater temperatures and strongly influence coral recovery. The site with the greatest depth range (3-5 m) and highest flow had the highest number of healthy corals nine months post-bleaching, although outcomes were not stratified by depth. Between the two shallower sites (1-3 m), the one exposed to swell waves supported greater recovery over the following months, while the site with no wave energy experienced high mortality. Both simple and complex morphotypes benefited from higher hydrodynamic energy, with simple colonies generally more resilient to heat stress. These findings emphasise the importance of physical site-specific characteristics in coral resilience and can guide more effective conservation and restoration strategies under future climate stress.",2025,Liav Meoded-Stern; Ana Paula Silva; Shawna A Foo; Alexander Waller; Maria Byrne; Ana Vila-Concejo,Marine environmental research
40972205,Risk-based framework to determine climate-informed design storms for road drainage infrastructure.,"Climate change is amplifying extreme precipitation events in many regions and imposes substantial challenges for the resilience of road drainage infrastructure. Conventional design storm methodologies, which rely on historical trends of rainfall data under a stationarity assumption, may not adequately account for future climate change and variability. This study introduces a risk-based framework for determining climate-informed design storms tailored to road drainage systems. The proposed framework integrates climate model projections with risk assessment to quantify the potential impacts of future extreme rainfall on drainage performance and adjust the future design storm, with a focus on the province of Ontario, Canada. Projected precipitation changes for mid- and late-century time horizons are quantified using statistically downscaled CMIP6 General Circulation Models (GCMs). The risk level is defined as a function of hazard and vulnerability, where hazard combines both physiographic and meteorological factors. Vulnerability is composed of socioeconomic, transportation, and environmental considerations. To systematically integrate these components, a weighting scheme is developed based on a sensitivity analysis of the criteria, which provides flexibility in assigning relative importance to each factor. The estimated risk level is then applied to adjust projected design storm accordingly. The proposed workflow is demonstrated through both province-wide and site-specific applications across Ontario's road network to better highlight its scalability and adaptability. The findings signify the necessity of shifting from static, stationarity-based design methodologies to dynamic, risk-informed approaches that enhance the long-term resilience of transportation networks.",2025,Mohammad Fereshtehpour; Rashid Bashir; Neil F Tandon,The Science of the total environment
40972192,"Assessing the impact of digitalization, geography, and digital mobility on air pollution in Europe & Central Asia: A climate change perspective.","Air pollution has increasingly become a significant driver of global warming, particularly due to the rapid expansion of industrial activities and unsustainable urbanization. This study aims to examine the influence of digitalization, digital mobility, and geography on air pollution across 40 European & Central Asian countries, using Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) to analyze panel data from 1995 to 2023. The findings reveal that, individually, digitalization, digital mobility, and geographical factors significantly contribute to increased air pollution levels in the region, resulting in rising temperatures and posing serious risks to human health and the environment. Notably, while underdeveloped digital infrastructure may amplify the environmental burden-particularly when compounded by geographic constraints-advanced digitalization can mitigate pollution through more efficient digital mobility and cleaner technologies. Moreover, the threshold effect suggests that digitalization must reach a sufficient level to mitigate effectively or potentially exacerbate the intensifying impact of digital mobility and geographical constraints on air pollution. Additionally, the analysis finds bidirectional causality between air pollution and the main explanatory variables: digitalization, digital mobility, and geography. Conversely, control variables such as fixed capital formation and GDP are associated with reductions in air pollution, while final consumption and population growth are found to exacerbate it. Policymakers are encouraged to leverage digital transformation not only for economic growth but also as a strategic tool to combat climate change and support sustainable development.",2025,Umer Shahzad; Changhong Miao,The Science of the total environment
40971986,Photoperiod does not affect thermal acclimation of shoot-scale gas exchange but is important for shoot development in cuttings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst).,"The growth of boreal trees is expected to benefit from increasing global temperatures through enhanced photosynthetic rates and longer growing seasons. However, since photoperiod is independent of climate change, it may limit the expected growth benefits from a longer growing season and could thus constrain boreal trees' physiological responses to warming. We carried out a growth chamber experiment on two-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies) cuttings from two latitudinal origins to investigate the interaction between day length (20/4 hours vs 14/10 hours light/dark) and enhanced temperatures (25/20 °C vs 15/10 °C day/night) on height growth, bud development and shoot-scale gas exchange. Height growth was greater under longer day length while bud development occurred faster both under longer day length and higher growth temperature. Growth temperature did not have a significant effect on the light-saturated photosynthetic rate but higher growth temperature resulted in lower dark respiration rate. Cuttings in the low growth temperature treatment exhibited higher apparent quantum yields indicating that lower growth temperature benefited net carbon uptake under low light availability, such as the conditions experienced by seedlings growing in the forest understory. Day length did not influence the thermal acclimation of shoot-scale gas exchange. The two populations from different origins did not differ in the measured parameters, except for a higher dark respiration rate in the high latitude cuttings. Overall, while day length did not affect the thermal acclimation of photosynthetic processes, it appears to constrain height growth and bud development, thereby reducing the potential performance benefit of a warming-induced lengthening of the growing season.",2025,Astrid Fridell; Göran Wallin; Curt Almqvist; Lasse Tarvainen,Tree physiology
40971876,"Discrepancy between active trachoma and tests of chlamydial infection in Alto Amazonas, Peru.","Trachoma mapping in Latin America is incomplete, especially in indigenous communities of the Amazon thought to be at highest risk. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of clinical, microbiological, and serologic evidence of trachoma in a remote area of the Peruvian Amazon. A population-based sample of households from rural communities in Alto Amazonas province was selected using two-stage cluster sampling. In children aged 1-9 years, conjunctival photographs, conjunctival swabs, and dried blood spots were collected. Photographs were graded for trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF). Swabs were processed for Chlamydia trachomatis with a nucleic acid amplification test. Dried blood spots were assessed for antibody responses to C. trachomatis with a multiplex bead assay. A total of 778 children aged 1-9 years from 21 communities participated. The age-adjusted prevalence of TF among 1-9-year-old children was 25.4% (95%CI 21.3-29.5%), compared with 0.8% (95%CI 0.5-1.0%) for ocular C. trachomatis and 6.6% (95%CI 4.5-9.0%) for Pgp3-specific antibodies to C. trachomatis. This region of the Peruvian Amazon had a high burden of clinical trachoma but low levels of C. trachomatis ocular infection and seropositivity.",2025,John M Nesemann; Noelia Morocho-Alburqueque; Alvaro Quincho-Lopez; Dionna M Wittberg; Harvy A Honorio-Morales; Salomón Durand; Martha Idalí Saboyá-Díaz; Silver K Vargas; Fisseha Admassu; Ana Bakthiari; Cristina Jimenez; Emma M Harding-Esch; Sandra L Talero; Marlene Muñoz; Anthony W Solomon; Jeffrey D Klausner; Andres G Lescano; Jeremy D Keenan,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
40971633,Inclusion of climate change and planetary health in masters of public health curricula in the UK.,"Due to the many health impacts of climate change, it is imperative to equip public health professionals with the skills and knowledge to work on climate mitigation and adaptation. However, it is unclear to what extent Masters of Public Health (MPH) include climate change and related subjects in their curricula. A survey was sent to MPH directors in the UK with questions about inclusion of climate change and related subjects in the curriculum. Russell group universities and those commissioned by NHS England Workforce, Training and Education were invited to take part. A total of 27 MPH courses were included (100% response rate). Climate change and related subjects were included in optional or core modules on other subjects, with health protection and health improvement being the most common. Two MPHs had only one lecture/seminar on climate change and one MPH did not cover these topics in the syllabus. The most common subject included in curricula was climate change (24, 89%). Most MPH directors wanted to increase the inclusion of climate change and planetary health in the curriculum (12, 55%) but could not do so due to lack of space within an already overloaded curriculum (10, 37%). Despite the recognition of the importance of climate change and health education by MPH course directors, the inclusion of those subjects in curricula remains variable and not as thorough as required given the importance of the topic. Addressing barriers is warranted to enable public health professionals to gain the required skills in climate mitigation and adaptation.",2025,Ana-Catarina Pinho-Gomes; Cecilia Sorensen; Danielly de Paiva Magalhães; Shakoor Hajat; Harry Rutter,European journal of public health
40971202,Factors relating to climate change anxiety in women at reproductive age: A CHAID analysis.,"This study aimed to determine the factors relating to climate change anxiety in women at reproductive age. This study is descriptive and cross-sectional. This study included 351 women aged 18-45 years. Data were collected via face to face interviews using the 'Women's Descriptive Characteristics and Climate Change Perception Assessment Form' and 'Climate Change Anxiety Scale for Women's Health' between June and October 2024 at a family health center in Mersin province of Türkiye. Data analysis included descriptive statistical methods and chi-squared automatic ınteraction detector analysis. The average age of the women was 27.91 ± 8.30 years (n = 351). The Climate Change Anxiety Scale for Women's Health mean score was 52.46 ± 17.19. Women's experience of anxiety regarding the negative consequences of climate change affected the scale and all sub-dimensions (physiological health, behavior, and gender) (p < 0.05). Health professionals should provide information and assessments including the effects of climate change on health in care services. They should plan interventions to reduce women's anxiety levels towards climate change.",2025,Tuğçe Sönmez; Enes Karaman,Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da U S P
40970595,Prevention or relief? Voters' support for disaster policies.,"Researchers have argued that preventing disasters is more efficient than providing relief. Yet, previous scholarship has found that voters in the United States reward politicians more for relief than for prevention policies. It is unclear, however, whether they truly favour relief policies or if they are simply more aware of them. In this article we report on an experiment in which American participants read about a fictional community facing a threat of flood and then rated their support for a disaster policy. Across conditions, we manipulated whether the policy is for relief or prevention, and whether the citizens are cooperative or uncooperative with respect to government policies. We found that participants did not support relief more than prevention; in fact, they favoured prevention when citizens were uncooperative. In addition, participants were less supportive of relief for uncooperative as compared to cooperative citizens, while cooperativeness did not affect support for the prevention policy.",2026,H Hana Kim; James Cragun; Peter DeScioli,Disasters
40970586,Response of nitrogen-fixing plant symbioses to changing temperature.,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is an effective strategy for legumes and actinorhizal plants to acquire atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) for their growth and development. Like other enzymatic processes in roots, the efficiency of SNF is highly dependent on soil temperature. Since global atmospheric temperature change also affects soil temperature, it is essential to know the temperature response of different types of plant-microbial symbioses capable of SNF at the molecular, physiological, and ecosystem levels on air and soil temperature changes. This is of particular significance, because the ability of nitrogen-fixing microbial symbionts to deal with temperature changes in the soil can affect growth and development of legumes and actinorhizal plants and, hence, the sustainability of ecosystems in a changing climate. However, temperature response may differ between different groups of nitrogen-fixing microbial symbionts (e.g., rhizobia vs. Frankia) and between different strains of the same microbial symbiont. In the present review, we summarize current knowledge on the temperature response of SNF, describe unexplored research topics, and propose future basic and applied research avenues under controlled conditions and in field studies. It provides a holistic view on the subject to encourage interdisciplinary research on this subject which has been largely neglected during the last decades, but of increasing significance due to global climate change.",2025,Tong Peng; Heinz Rennenberg; Bin Hu,Journal of integrative plant biology
40970515,"Climate-Driven Variability in Flowering Phenology Changes Across Subtropical Mountains: Traits, Elevation Shifts, and Biogeographic Patterns.","Flowering phenology has major impacts on physiological processes, survival, and reproductive success in angiosperms, serving as a critical biological indicator of climate change impacts. However, changes in flowering phenology and their determinants in subtropical montane ecosystems remain poorly quantified at continental extents. Here we investigated the determinants of flowering phenology shifts over the past century across 11 subtropical mountains in China. Based on century-long herbarium collections of 784 flowering plant species in these mountains, we first used linear regression models to assess the magnitude and direction of changes in flowering time for each species in each mountain separately. Then, we investigated the underlying drivers of changes in flowering time, including climate changes, species traits as well as changes in species elevation range size. Our analyses revealed an average advancement in flowering phenology of 3.8 days per decade, though marked regional disparities emerged: flowering times were advanced in southeastern mountains but delayed in southwestern ones. Climate change, species functional traits, and mountain properties all had significant effects on the observed changes in flowering time. Notably, the flowering time of lowland and non-native plants was advanced more than that of alpine and native plants. A key finding was the negative correlation between flowering time changes and elevational range expansions, supporting the hypothesis that phenological plasticity facilitates range adjustments under environmental change. These findings demonstrate that flowering phenological responses are context-dependent, mediated by complex biotic-abiotic interactions. Our study provides the first biogeographical assessment of flowering phenology shifts in subtropical Asian mountains, offering critical insights for predicting ecosystem stability and informing biodiversity conservation strategies under ongoing climate change.",2025,Kuiling Zu; Zhiheng Wang; Fusheng Chen; Jonathan Lenoir; Xiangmin Fang; Fangchao Wang; Wensheng Bu; Jianjun Li; Yuan Luo; Yunyun Wang; Wenqi Song,Global change biology
40970348,Homoploid Hybrid Speciation in a Marine Pelagic Fish.,"Homoploid hybrid speciation (HHS) is an enigmatic evolutionary process where new species arise through hybridisation of divergent lineages without changes in chromosome number. Although increasingly documented in various taxa and ecosystems, convincing cases of HHS in marine fishes have been lacking. This study presents a possible case of HHS in a pelagic marine fish based on comprehensive genomic, morphological, and ecological analyses. Population genomics, species tree estimation, and tests of introgression and admixture identified three sympatric clusters in Megalaspis cordyla in the western Pacific and the admixed nature of one cluster between the others. Moreover, model-based demographic inference favoured a hybrid speciation scenario over introgression for the origin of the admixed cluster. While contemporary gene flow suggested partial reproductive isolation, examination of occurrence data and ecologically relevant morphological characters suggested ecological differences between the clusters, potentially contributing to the reproductive isolation and niche partitioning in sympatry. The clusters are also morphologically distinguishable and thus can be taxonomically recognised as separate species. The hybrid cluster is restricted to the coasts of Taiwan and Japan, where all three clusters coexist. The parental clusters are additionally found in lower latitudes, where they display non-overlapping distributions. Given the geographical distributions, estimated times of species formation, and patterns of historical demographic changes, we propose that the Pleistocene glacial cycles were the primary driver of HHS in this system. We also develop an ecogeographic model of HHS in marine coastal ecosystems, including a novel hypothesis to explain the initial stages of HHS.",2025,Nozomu Muto; Yong-Chao Su; Harutaka Hata; Nguyen Van Quan; Veera Vilasri; Mazlan Abd Ghaffar; Ricardo P Babaran,Molecular ecology
40970343,"Post-fledging ecology of birds: emergent patterns, knowledge gaps, and future frontiers.","The post-fledging period - the time between a juvenile bird leaving its nest and dispersing or migrating from its natal site - is a critical yet challenging aspect of avian ecology to study. Past reviews have advanced our knowledge of the post-fledging period by focusing on a particular topic or taxon but have yet to describe patterns of survival and behaviour across the entire post-fledging literature. Here we review research on the post-fledging ecology of birds across taxa to (i) synthesize emergent patterns, (ii) highlight critical knowledge gaps, and (iii) identify promising future frontiers in research. Our review revealed a general dichotomy in the post-fledging literature, with studies on altricial and precocial birds using different terminology and rarely citing one another. Consequently, we compared the post-fledging ecology of altricial and precocial birds while synthesizing patterns and knowledge gaps in the literature. We showed that altricial and precocial birds share many similarities in their post-fledging behaviour, movement, habitat use, parental care, and survival, despite key differences in their ontogenies (e.g. development in the egg and nestling period length). In particular, altricial and precocial birds showed similar trends in fledgling survival with age (positive association), exhibit similarities in selecting post-fledging habitat (often selecting for denser, more complex vegetation that provides cover), and in movement strategies (moving less at younger age to avoid predator detection). Differences were also apparent, with altricial and precocial birds differing in key traits that carry over from the nesting stage to influence fledgling survival (e.g. mass versus wing development). Nevertheless, differences in descriptions of the post-fledging period have, in part, resulted in studies on altricial and precocial birds being disconnected in the literature, highlighting a need for a unifying, standardized terminology for the period after birds leave the nest. Comparative studies and meta-analyses across the altricial-precocial spectrum are also needed to bridge the two worlds. The post-fledging field has grown steadily over the past few decades, but this life-history stage remains understudied for nearly 90% of avian taxa and important frontiers remain largely unexplored: understudied geographical regions and taxa, brood parasites, ecophysiology, impacts of urbanization and climate-induced environmental change, and impacts of technology used to study this period. Our review emphasizes the importance of the post-fledging period for avian population dynamics and life histories, and highlights the great potential of research into this key developmental stage to advance our understanding of the ecology, evolution, and conservation of birds.",2025,Todd M Jones; Sara A Kaiser; T Scott Sillett,Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society
40970290,"Lessons From Federally Qualified Health Centers in the US Territories on Managing Non-Communicable Diseases in the Setting of Disasters: A Qualitative Study Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) Framework.","This study examines disaster preparedness and response in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which serve vulnerable populations, including individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Hurricanes Irma and Maria revealed gaps in chronic disease management, contributing to significant mortality. Climate change will likely exacerbate these challenges, necessitating a deeper understanding of preparedness factors. Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, we conducted a qualitative study of 2 FQHCs in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, analyzing inner (leadership, organizational culture, and staff dynamics) and outer (funding, networks, and policies) contextual factors. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were analyzed thematically utilizing the EPIS framework. Interviews with 24 staff members highlighted strong leadership valuing both employees and patients, prior disaster experience, and a culture of continuous improvement as essential for preparedness. Personal support systems improved staff engagement, while external collaborations with relief organizations enhanced response efforts. Flexible policies allowing access to medication and healthcare services beyond insurance coverage were critical for NCD patients during disasters.

40970215,A systematic review of food-environment interactions in catchment models.,"This paper provides a systematic review of food-environment interactions in catchment models, focusing on the complex relationships between land use, ecosystem services, and agricultural production. The review highlights the importance of catchment-scale models in understanding the impact of land use on local ecosystems, particularly in relation to water quality, biodiversity, and soil services. By examining various international catchment-scale models, with an emphasis on the micro and macro disparities, the paper identifies key methodological lessons and future opportunities to enhance these frameworks for more effective policy design and environmental management. The review is structured around a conceptual framework that categorises models into environmental models, which focus on ecosystem dynamics, and physical models, which examine structural and material aspects of land use systems, as well as human dimensions, with a specific focus on reducing net emissions and improving land productivity. This relationship is described through a conceptual framework. The paper also emphasises the significance of spatial and temporal factors in these models, noting gaps in the literature limited integration of food production into catchment models, underrepresentation of localised/catchment-level modelling, data limitations, particularly lack of georeferenced micro-level data, inadequate incorporation of climate change scenarios and temporal variability, weak integration of biophysical, economic, and social factors, insufficient analysis of policy and governance impacts at catchment scale and lack of farm-specific, actionable recommendations. The research highlights the critical need for enhanced data accessibility, environmental model maintainability, standardised land use variable definitions, and improved georeferencing in land use modelling. The findings emphasise the importance of long-term projections, integration of social, economic, and biophysical factors, and open data initiatives to bolster essential research infrastructure and foster stakeholder engagement for more effective agricultural policy and environmental management.",2025,Luke Roche; Cathal O'Donoghue; David Styles,Discover agriculture
40970204,Ocean warming drives tissue-wide metabolic reprogramming in a fish.,"Ocean warming and marine heatwaves are predicted to have adverse impacts on marine organisms. Yet, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underpin successful or failed acclimation to increasing temperatures remains incomplete. We conducted an aquaria-based study of early-life stage clownfish comprising of six thermal regimes, measuring the metabolic, and multi-tissue transcriptional response of <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i> using seven tissues. Sampling at 31°C increased metabolic rates in fish reared at 28°C; however, these effects were reduced with increasing developmental rearing at 31°C. Transcriptomic analysis revealed multi-tissue reprogramming of metabolic processes at +3°C, particularly in the liver-pancreas axis. Importantly, chronic larval-juvenile exposure to +3°C induced the acclimation of metabolic rates and caused the upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (liver) and the downregulation of insulin secretion (pancreas). These results indicate that temperature increase will drive tissue-wide metabolic reprogramming in fish, with changes in key energetic pathways underpinning fish's ability to acclimate to warming.",2025,Billy Moore; Shannon McMahon; Michael Izumiyama; Taewoo Ryu; Timothy Ravasi,iScience
40970201,Seasonal shifts in pan-Arctic Ocean downward radiation and key drivers.,"The Arctic, highly sensitive to climate change, is warming rapidly due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a significant rise in downward radiation over the pan-Arctic Ocean in recent decades. However, the key drivers and their relative contributions remain unclear. This study identifies and quantifies the seasonal impacts of four critical environmental factors-temperature, sea ice concentration (SIC), specific humidity, and latent heat flux-on downward radiation. Results show that temperature dominates during the cold season (October-March), contributing 39.33%, while in the warm season (April-September), temperature and SIC are primary contributors, at 42.18% and -30.57%, respectively. Notably, latent heat flux has a contrasting seasonal effect: it enhances radiation in the cold season but suppresses it in the warm season. These findings reveal the mechanisms underlying Arctic radiative changes and offer valuable insights into the region's climate response under global warming.",2025,Yujun Liu; Haiyan Li; Yijun He; Yingying Liu,iScience
40970194,Guidelines for inclusive and equitable energy and transport modeling.,"Energy and transport models are powerful tools for shaping policy, development pathways, and financial decisions. However, these models often fail to account for gender equality and social inclusion (GESI), perpetuating systemic inequities and excluding the needs of marginalized communities. This perspective presents guidelines, developed through a collaborative process informed by a scoping literature review and expert consultation with modelers and social scientists, for integrating GESI into large-scale energy and transport systems modeling processes, particularly in low- and lower middle-income countries. By addressing key challenges-such as data disaggregation, the limits of current model architectures, and the complexities of quantifying social factors-we outline steps to incorporate GESI considerations throughout every stage of the modeling life cycle. While developed with energy and transport systems in mind, the principles of these guidelines are broadly applicable to other infrastructure modeling domains. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how inclusive modeling practices can produce more equitable, context-sensitive results, and foster sustainable development outcomes.",2025,Marissa Bergman; Julia Tomei; Stephanie Hirmer; Beatrice Stockport; Fatima Afifah; James Dixon; Leonhard Hofbauer; Alycia Leonard; Pietro Lubello; Elena Pierard Manzano; Brunilde Verrier; Margaux Daly; Neve Fields; Francesco Gardumi; Steve Pye; Mourice Kausya; Kirsty Mackinlay; Kevin Nayema; Elsie Onsongo; Divya Subash Kumar,iScience
40970164,Changes in potential distribution and cultivation areas of <i>Allium victorialis</i> L. under climate change.,"Climate change has profoundly reshaped the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of plants. <i>A. victorialis</i>, a wild vegetable with significant edible and medicinal value, is highly favored by residents in the upper reaches of the Dadu River - Minjiang River, leading to its extensive collection and utilization. This study simulated the potential distribution of <i>A. victorialis</i> in the upper reaches of the Dadu River-Minjiang River using an ensemble model, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, the migration patterns of the centroid of suitable habitats, and its ecological niche. Additionally, a production dynamic model integrating ecological suitability and nutritional components of <i>A. victorialis</i> was constructed to delineate its current and future potential cultivation areas. The results demonstrated that the annual temperature range, precipitation in the warmest quarter, and temperature seasonality coefficient are the main factors restricting the potential distribution of <i>A. victorialis</i> Multivariate environmental similarity and the most dissimilar variable analysis revealed significant climate anomalies in the study area, indicating that future climate change will have a substantial impact on <i>A. victorialis.</i> In the current period, the suitable habitats and high-yield cultivation areas of <i>A. victorialis</i> are concentrated in low-altitude river valleys in the upper reaches of the Dadu River - Minjiang River. Under future scenarios, highly suitable habitats and first-class cultivation areas will face shrinkage, with the ecological niche and distribution centroid migrating northeastward. By 2090, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the changes will be most drastic: first-class cultivation areas will disappear entirely, and highly suitable habitats will be nearly lost. This study will facilitate the development of suitable management strategies for <i>A. victorialis</i> in the upper reaches of the Dadu River-Minjiang River, providing a scientific reference for the sustainable utilization of mountain plant resources under climate change.",2025,Yi Huang; Jian Yang; Guanghua Zhao; Yang Yang; Wuzhi Jiaba; Jialin Li; Tingyong Yang; Jianmin Yao,Frontiers in plant science

40969604,"Market shocks, climate vulnerability, and income loss in informal indigenous food systems: evidence from street vendors in Durban, South Africa.","Indigenous food crops are vital for nutrition security, climate resilience, and inclusive livelihoods, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 13 (Climate Action). Yet, the street vendors who distribute these crops remain highly vulnerable to overlapping socio-environmental disruptions. This study investigates how compound shocks (the 2022 Durban floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 civil unrest) affect the economic sustainability of indigenous food crop vendors in South Africa. A cross-sectional survey of 34 vendors at Durban's Warwick Early Morning Market was conducted, with data analyzed using descriptive statistics, and robust regression modeling. Results show that 88% of vendors experienced income loss due to flooding, 71% due to COVID-19, and 68% due to unrest. The regression model identified lack of cold storage (<i>β</i> = 1.53, <i>p</i> < 0.01), crop perishability (<i>β</i> = 1.10, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and exposure to these shocks as statistically significant predictors of income reduction. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive urban food governance, investment in post-harvest infrastructure, and support for informal vendors as key actors in achieving SDG-aligned, climate-resilient food systems.",2025,Xolile Mkhize; Thobani Cele,Frontiers in nutrition
40969559,The attribution of human health outcomes to climate change: a transdisciplinary guidance document.,"For over 30 years, detection and attribution (D&A) studies have informed key conclusions in international and national assessments of climate science, providing compelling evidence for the reality and seriousness of the human effects on the global climate. In the early 21st century, D&A methods were adapted to assess the contribution of climate change to longer-term trends in earth system processes and extreme weather events. More recently, attribution research helped quantify the health and economic impacts of climate change. Here we provide guidance for transdisciplinary collaboration in designing, conducting, interpreting, and reporting robust and policy-relevant attribution analyses of human health outcomes. This guidance resulted from discussions among experts in health and climate science. Recommended steps include co-developing the research question across disciplines; establishing a transdisciplinary analytic team with fundamental grounding in the core disciplines; engaging meaningfully with relevant stakeholders and decision-makers to define an appropriate study design and analytic process, including defining the exposure event or trend; identifying, visualizing, and describing linkages in the causal pathway from exposure to weather/climate variables to the health outcome(s) of interest; choosing appropriate counterfactual climate data, and where applicable, to evaluate the skill of the climate and process or empirical health model(s) used in D&A research; quantifying the attributable changes in climate variables; quantifying the attributable health impacts within the context of other determinants of exposure and vulnerability; and reporting key results, including a description of how recommendations were incorporated into the analytical plan. Implementation of guidance would benefit diverse stakeholders including researchers, research funders, policymakers, and climate litigation by harmonizing methods and increasing confidence in findings.",2025,K Ebi; A Haines; R F S Andrade; C Åström; M L Barreto; A Bonell; N Brink; C Caminade; C J Carlson; R Carter; P Chua; G Cissé; F J Colón-González; S Dasgupta; L A Galvao; M Garrido Zornoza; A Gasparrini; G Gordon-Strachan; S Hajat; S Harper; L J Harrington; M Hashizume; J Hess; J Hilly; V Ingole; L V Jacobson; T Kapwata; C Keeler; S A Kidd; E W Kimani-Murage; R K Kolli; S Kovats; S Li; R Lowe; D Mitchell; K Murray; M New; O E Ogunniyi; S E Perkins-Kirkpatrick; J Pescarini; B L Pineda Restrepo; S T R Pinho; V Prescott; N Redvers; S Ryan; B Santer; C-F Schleussner; J C Semenza; M Taylor; L Temple; S Thiam; W Thiery; A M Tompkins; S Undorf; A M Vicedo-Cabrera; K Wan; R Warren; C Webster; A Woodward; C Wright; R F Stuart-Smith,Climatic change
40969535,Photoprotective pigment plasticity and cold acclimation strategies in <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> across two common gardens.,"To cope with winter stress from low temperatures and excessive light, evergreen conifers employ seasonal adjustments in photosynthetic function. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is critical for predicting coniferous forest responses to climate change and their role in the global carbon cycle. To assess variation in cold acclimation strategies, the following were analyzed: pigment composition, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, and photosynthetic parameters in three to five provenances (Prv) of <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> grown in two common gardens (CGs) with contrasting climates. All Prv exhibited winter chlorophyll reduction, increased xanthophyll cycle, lutein pigments, and rhodoxanthin accumulation, reflecting conserved photoprotective responses. However, needle chlorophyll concentrations were unexpectedly higher in the colder site, especially in the northernmost Prv, suggesting genotype-specific plasticity. Higher rhodoxanthin levels in the hotter sites indicated a trade-off between the xanthophyll cycle and rhodoxanthin-mediated protection governed by winter severity. Despite these differences, values of photochemical efficiency of photosystem II were similar among Prv within each garden, though consistently higher in the hotter garden. No significant variation in photosynthetic capacity was detected among the three Prv measured. This local adaptation is further supported by high phenotypic plasticity in pigment composition and leaf morphology. These findings highlight the diverse and flexible mechanisms by which <i>C. japonica</i> regulates pigment composition, enabling sustained photosynthesis across seasonal extremes, and suggest a role for both winter cold and summer heat in shaping local adaptation in this widely distributed conifer.",2025,Qingmin Han; Norihisa Kusumoto; Seiichi Kanetani; Yoshihisa Suyama; Yuki Tsujii; Daisuke Kabeya; Yoshihiko Tsumura; Kentaro Uchiyama,Forestry research
40969336,Scalable CO<sub>2</sub> Removal Using Electricity: Research Needs in Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis.,"Electrochemical direct air capture (DAC) potentially represents a transformative solution in the fight against climate change. Herein we provide a critical perspective on pH-swing approaches, which leverage pH shifts to enhance CO<sub>2</sub> capture and release while minimizing energy demands and improving scalability. In particular, bipolar membrane electrodialysis offers promise. Widespread adoption requires overcoming challenges across molecular, micro-, and system scales. At the molecular scale, development of durable ion exchange layers and their integration into bipolar membranes with high ion conductivity, permselectivity, and stability is critical. At the microscale, stack designs must minimize energy losses by optimizing fluid dynamics, current densities, faradaic efficiencies, and pH gradients. At the system level, scalable DAC systems must integrate renewable energy and advanced CO<sub>2</sub> uptake strategies, such as enhanced solvent/electrolyte formulations and innovative reactor configurations. By addressing these milestones, electrochemical DAC can achieve intensified processes with improved energy efficiency, reduced costs, and higher CO<sub>2</sub>-removal capacities.",2025,Zarko P Jovanov; Dingchang Yang; Carla Glassl; Qilei Song; Ifan E L Stephens,ACS energy letters
40968675,Intraspecific support for the Climate Variability Hypothesis: Oxidative damage in lizards after acute temperature exposure.,"Ectotherms face mounting challenges from climate variability. The Climate Variability Hypothesis predicts that species from more variable environments will exhibit greater physiological resilience, but this has been largely untested within a species. Because ectotherm metabolic rates increase with temperature, mitochondrial function and its byproduct, reactive oxygen species, may play key roles in this thermal resilience. This study examined how temperature affects oxidative damage in prairie lizards (Sceloporus consobrinus) from three populations (northern, central, southern) along a latitudinal gradient in two separate experiments on different individuals. In the first experiment, lizards were exposed to day-long thermal exposures (18°C and 37°C). Oxidative damage, measured as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), increased in only the central and southern populations after cold exposure. Notably, the northern population, consistent with predictions of the Climate Variability Hypothesis, showed no increase, suggesting possible adaptations to mitigate cold-induced oxidative damage. In the second experiment, we tested whether oxidative damage was triggered by cold exposure or subsequent rewarming. Again, northern lizards showed no change, while southern lizards increased damage with faster rewarming rates. Finally, we found that 8-OHdG decreased 24-hrs after the cold exposure and rewarming, indicating it may be reversible. Collectively, these results provide the first intraspecific evidence for the Climate Variability Hypothesis in a vertebrate ectotherm. This suggests that cold-adapted lizards possess mechanisms to buffer oxidative damage, emphasizing the role of mitochondrial function and oxidative resilience in shaping thermal tolerances.",2025,Benjamin D Haussmann; Nicole A Joseph; Tiffany R Hegdahl; Kayla E Lichtner; Redeit N Woldebirhan; Benjamin G Travis; Garret P Peterson; Travis R Robbins; Mark F Haussmann,The Journal of experimental biology
40968491,Nitrogen enrichment reduces parasitism in an annual hemiparasite.,"Anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel combustion and synthetic fertilizer synthesis have resulted in nitrogen (N) deposition and elevated N availability in ecosystems. Many parasitic plants are adapted to low N environments and have evolved mechanisms to sequester water, N, and other limiting nutrients from hosts. Anthropogenic N deposition may perturb these host-parasite interactions, thereby altering nutrient cycling and ultimately reducing biodiversity. To test how N enrichment affects the incidence and degree of plant parasitism, we assayed host-parasite performance and in vitro root growth under supplemental N levels representative of urban areas experiencing N deposition. We focused on the annual hemiparasite Castilleja exserta and two co-occurring host species, Nasella lepida and N. pulchra. Elevated N decreased haustoria formation and host-seeking behavior by roots but did not affect growth, suggesting N enrichment may reduce parasitism without associated loss of parasite biomass. We confirmed that parasitism decreased host performance and that the degree of parasitism was positively related to host biomass and earlier flowering. We also found N. lepida may be preferred over N. pulchra as a host. These results indicate that N pollution altered parasitism in C. exserta and highlight the far-reaching ecological effects of N pollution on host-parasite interactions within plant communities.",2025,Jasmine Taite; Paul D Nabity,American journal of botany
40968129,Seaweed as a climate fix for meat and dairy production: an LCA perspective.,"Livestock supply chains contribute a substantial share of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with enteric methane (CH₄) from ruminants being a key driver. Seaweed-derived feed additives have been proposed as a CH₄ mitigation strategy, but their broader environmental trade-offs remain unclear. This study applies life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate seven seaweed-supplemented scenarios across beef, dairy, and sheep production, assessing climate change, marine and freshwater eutrophication, land use, fossil fuel depletion, and water use. Results indicate that while certain seaweed additives can lower CH₄ emissions in vitro, real-world reductions in total GHG emissions remain modest. Energy-intensive processing and long transport distances can offset CH₄ abatement gains, with only scenarios utilizing low-impact by-products achieving net climate benefits. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of Global Warming Potential (GWP) time horizon selection, energy sources, and grazing practices in determining overall environmental performance. Optimizing algae sourcing, processing, and application will be essential to realizing meaningful and scalable mitigation potential in ruminant systems. While seaweed additives can contribute to CH₄ reduction, this study concludes they will not single-handedly deliver transformative climate benefits.",2025,J-B E Thomas; V W Xu; S J Krizsan; I M Aasen; A Oliveira; H Ramos; P Tyedmers; M Hayes; F Gröndahl,Scientific reports

40967737,Moisture Matters: How Water Shapes Pest Invasions and Disease Outbreaks?,"Water availability and its distribution within plant tissues significantly influence photosynthesis, metabolism, transpiration, and crop susceptibility to pests and diseases. Both abiotic (e.g., drought, salinity, heat) and biotic stresses (e.g., insect pests, pathogens) disrupt plant water status, shaping plant responses across physiological, metabolic, and behavioral levels. These responses are highly variable and depend on stress intensity, plant adaptive capacity, pest or pathogen traits, and interactions with natural predators. This review presents the current understanding of the complex interplay between plant water dynamics, pest infestations, and disease development, with particular emphasis on their combined effects on crop resilience. Although considerable progress has been made in studying plant responses to individual abiotic or biotic stressors, the integrative role of water content in mediating plant-pest-pathogen interactions remains insufficiently explored. This review highlights how water stress can compromise plant structure and function, thereby increasing vulnerability to herbivory and infection. Critical research gaps are identified, particularly concerning simultaneous stress scenarios and the influence of soil properties on water-mediated responses. The review also examines the potential of advanced tools such as genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9), transcriptomics, and precision irrigation technologies for enhancing plant tolerance and reducing reliance on agrochemicals. The potential of biological control for mitigating pest pressure and alleviating water stress is discussed, including the use of natural enemies such as predatory insects and entomopathogenic fungi, which contribute to sustainable pest management. Overall, integrated water and pest management strategies are essential for maintaining crop productivity and resilience, particularly under the increasing challenges posed by climate change.",2025,Maroa Mohammed Al-Aisaee; Muhammad Amjad Ali; Ahmad Nawaz; Abdullah M Al-Sadi; Muhammad Farooq,Physiologia plantarum
40967668,Need to address mental health within climate change education.,"Education plays a crucial role in equipping young people with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the challenges of adulthood. In the context of the escalating climate crisis, climate change education (CCE) has an essential role in this aim. Despite an increase of research in the area, where young people have been identified as being particularly concerned about climate change, CCE continues to be under-represented in the UK curriculum. This article explores critical considerations for developing an effective approach to CCE. It emphasises the importance of young people's emotional responses to this aspect of their education that can shape their engagement with the topic. It addresses the need to consider how informal learning through social media and online platforms can have a significant impact on views of the crisis, as well as behaviour. Finally, the article proposes several evidence-based strategies to enhance the integration of CCE into formal education, fostering both critical engagement and actionable understanding among students.",2025,Fionnuala Mottishaw; Sarah MacQuarrie,BMJ mental health
40967552,Global warming amplifies wildfire health burden and reshapes inequality.,"Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions<sup>1</sup>. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures<sup>2</sup>. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Here we show that from 2010-2014 to 2095-2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66-2.25) million annually during 2095-2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1-2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts.",2025,Junri Zhao; Bo Zheng; Philippe Ciais; Yang Chen; Thomas Gasser; Josep G Canadell; Longyi Zhang; Qiang Zhang,Nature
40967551,Wildfire smoke exposure and mortality burden in the US under climate change.,"Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change <sup>1-3</sup>. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and empirically estimate smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) - a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US <sup>4,5</sup>. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.",2025,Minghao Qiu; Jessica Li; Carlos F Gould; Renzhi Jing; Makoto Kelp; Marissa L Childs; Jeff Wen; Yuanyu Xie; Meiyun Lin; Mathew V Kiang; Sam Heft-Neal; Noah S Diffenbaugh; Marshall Burke,Nature
40967498,Extreme Weather Events and Early Childhood Growth in Low- and Middle-Income Regions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Extreme weather, a significant yet often underrecognized risk factor for early childhood growth, increasingly threatens child nutrition and health, particularly among children under five. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on the associations between extreme weather events and early childhood growth outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was performed across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2024. The random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (ORs) assessing the associations between extreme weather events and child growth outcomes, with subgroup analyses by the exposure type and the children age. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for both cohort and cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and publication bias was examined through funnel plots and Egger's tests. Our search initially identified 2,874 records, of which 18 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed significant associations between extreme weather events and reduced height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) (β = -0.08; 95% CI: -0.12, -0.04), as well as increased odds of stunting (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.36). Subgroup analyses of HAZ indicated strong negative associations for drought (β = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.16, -0.05), extreme rainfall (β = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.15, -0.07), and among children under five years (β = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.13 to -0.03). There was substantial heterogeneity for both HAZ (I<sup>2</sup> = 76%) and stunting (I<sup>2</sup> = 97%). Weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) also exhibited a negative association (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01), whereas wasting showed no significant association. The risk of bias was generally low. However, publication bias was detected for WHZ and wasting outcomes. Our findings indicated that extreme weather events were significantly associated with adverse outcomes of early childhood growth, especially concerning linear growth and stunting. Integrating climate resilience into early childhood health planning is crucial to protect and promote child growth and development amid a progressively uncertain climate future.",2025,Xuechun Wang; Lu Lan; Xing Xing; Wenyu Yang; He Zhu; Ruoxi Ding,Environmental research
40967461,"Weak recovery of insectivorous bird populations after ban of neonicotinoid in France, hinting at lasting impacts.","Neonicotinoids are expected to play a significant role in the decline of bird populations through their adverse effects on food resources (primarily insects) and to their lethal and sub-lethal toxicity. Previous studies in the US and the Netherlands have shown links between neonicotinoid use and bird abundance, but the potential for population recovery after ban has not been investigated. Here, we investigated this relationship in France over the 2013 - 2022 period, focusing on 57 bird species from insectivorous, granivorous and generalist guilds, surveyed across a large number of plots (n = 1983). We specifically examined imidacloprid, the most widely sold neonicotinoid in France before its ban in 2018, which is still found in surface waters and soils. Additionally, we accounted for potential effects of other pesticides by calculating the Total Applied Toxicity (TAT) for different species groups, as well as landscape and climate factors. We found that population abundance of insectivorous birds was negatively associated with imidacloprid use. We also found that the difference in insectivorous bird abundance between sites with high versus no imidacloprid use was slightly higher before the ban (12.7% more birds in sites with no imidacloprid) than after (9%), suggesting only weak recovery of their populations. In contrast, granivorous and generalist species showed neutral or non-linear associations with other pesticide use and no response to imidacloprid. Our study confirms the detrimental impact of imidacloprid on insectivorous birds and highlights that pesticide bans alone do not ensure immediate biodiversity recovery. This calls for additional conservation actions in landscapes contaminated with neonicotinoids to restore insect and bird populations.",2025,Thomas Perrot; Karine Princé; Emmanuelle Porcher; Jakob Wolfram; Ralf Schulz; Colin Fontaine,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)"
40967332,"N-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in fish physiology: From aquaculture to economic, ecologic and public health challenges.","N-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC PUFA), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential molecules to fish physiology, influencing their development, metabolism, immunity, behavior, and reproduction. However, fish have a limited ability to synthesize these fatty acids endogenously, and must obtain them through diet. The dietary availability of these molecules is increasingly challenged by both ecological and aquaculture constraints linked to climate change and to sustainability of ressources (e.g. fisheries). Currently, global changes - including ocean warming - may reduce the availability of these fatty acids in marine food webs, raising concerns for fish population dynamics and aquaculture sustainability that still largely depends on forage fish. In this review, we first summarize the metabolic pathways and tissue distribution of n-3 LC PUFA in freshwater and marine fish, highlighting differences in bioconversion capacities. We then explore the physiological and behavioral consequences of varying dietary n-3 LC PUFA levels in aquaculture feeds and natural environments, including effects on growth, locomotion, cognition, metabolic performance, oxidative status, immune response, and reproductive investment. We also review current alternatives to fish meal and fish oil, such as plant, insect, microbial, and genetically modified sources, and discuss their potential to meet fish nutritional needs. Altogether, this synthesis underscores the current challenge of n-3 LC PUFA dietary shortage for fish health, aquaculture production and nutritional security of human population, and identifies knowledge gaps that must be addressed to ensure both ecological resilience and sustainable aquaculture development in a rapidly changing world.",2025,Mickael Péron; Mathilde Bertrand; Elodie Baranek; Maud Martinat; Philippe Soudant; Marie Vagner; Jérôme Roy,Biochimie
40967233,"The health, environmental, and cost implications of providing healthy and sustainable school meals for every child by 2030: a global modelling study.","School meal programmes are thought to improve dietary behaviour in children, with benefits sustained throughout the life course, making them important catalysts for wider food-system change. However, only one in five children globally currently receives school meals. We estimated the potential effects of extending school meal coverage to all children by 2030 for dietary health; the environmental effects related to diets; and the costs of diets at global, regional, and national levels. We conducted health, environmental, and cost assessments of future scenarios of school meal coverage, meal frequency, meal composition, and food wastage. In the health assessment, we used statistical methods and a comparative risk assessment to estimate short-term changes in undernourishment and long-term changes in dietary risks and mortality. In the environmental assessment, we used food-related environmental footprints to analyse how changes in dietary composition and food waste affect greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and freshwater use. In the cost assessment, we used an international dataset of food prices to estimate changes in diet costs, and we used estimates of the social cost of carbon and the costs of illness to estimate changes in the costs of climate-change damages and in health-related costs. Extending school meal programmes to all children globally by 2030 could be associated with substantial health and environmental benefits globally and in each country. In the model assessments, the prevalence of undernourishment in food-insecure populations was reduced by a quarter due to having an additional meal at school; more than 1 million cases of non-communicable diseases were prevented globally per year if dietary habits were partly sustained into adulthood; and food-related environmental effects were halved if meal composition adhered to recommendations for healthy and sustainable diets and food waste was reduced. Increasing school meal coverage incurred additional meal-related costs that ranged from 0·1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in high-income countries to 1·0% of GDP in low-income countries. Reductions in the external costs of climate-change damages and the costs of illness compensated for the costs of providing meals in line with health and sustainable diets. Universal school meal coverage could make important contributions to improving children's health, the food security of their families, and the sustainability of food systems. However, dedicated policy and financial support will be required to close the gap in school meal coverage, especially in low-income countries.

40967098,High temperatures amplify aggressiveness of an invasive lizard toward a native congener.,"Invasive species cause major disturbances to endemic wildlife and often displace native species. Behavioral aggression can contribute to invasive species success, but little is known about how temperature and aggression interact. We tested for effects of temperature on interspecific aggression between the invasive brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) and a native congener, the green anole (A. carolinensis). Anolis sagrei displaces A. carolinensis from perch sites in sympatry, which is hypothesized to result at least in part from higher levels of aggression. We tested hypotheses about the temperature-dependence of interspecific aggression across five ecologically relevant temperature regimes that span cool spring to hot summer conditions. Additionally, we tested whether the presence of A. sagrei disrupts A. carolinensis thermoregulation. The invasive Anolis sagrei was more aggressive than A. carolinensis in all temperature regimes. In addition, the difference in aggression between the species was greatest at high temperatures. In contrast, we found little evidence that A. carolinensis thermoregulation is affected by A. sagrei. Our results indicate that the effects of an invasive lizard on a native competitor may be facilitated by high levels of aggression that could be amplified with rising temperatures. Overall, our results are consistent with aggression facilitating invasive species success, and that the effect can be amplified under climate change.",2025,Julie E Rej; Alex R Gunderson,Journal of thermal biology
40966989,Bacterial and Vibrio community diversity in tropical rock oysters in northern Australia.,"Tropical rock oyster aquaculture is an emerging industry for most countries in the Asia-Pacific, including tropical north Australia. Food safety is an important element, but there exist large gaps in our understanding of the risks posed by potential pathogens including virulent Vibrio strains. To start to address this, oysters were collected from 13 sites across northern Australia to measure their bacterial community, including Vibrio. The dominant bacterial families were the Spirochaetaceae, Mycoplasmataceae and Vibrionaceae. The most abundant Vibrio species were V. parahaemolyticus, V. harveyi and V. diabolicus, but other potential human pathogenic species were detected including V. vulnificus. V. parahaemolyticus levels were above recommended guidelines in 37 % of oysters but virulence genes trh or tdh were not detected; V. vulnificus was detected in 31 % of oyster samples. Eleven potential oyster Vibrio pathogens were identified. Our results show that although food safety Vibrio species were prevalent, virulence genes were not. This highlights the need to focus on virulence rather than species abundance to obtain a realistic measure of risk.",2025,A C Padovan; S Nowland; M Kaestli; N Siboni; Z Tinning; J R Seymour; K S Gibb,Marine environmental research
40966948,Co-elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature increase rice yield but degrade nutrient quality in a cold temperature region.,"The responses of three Japonica rice cultivars were investigated throughout a full growing season in computer-controlled open-top chambers under four treatments: control (CK), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (700 ppm, eC), elevated temperature (+2 °C, eT), and their combination (eCeT). To assess the impact of climate change factors, the present study performed comprehensive physiological measurements and flag leaf transcriptomic analysis to evaluate rice yield and quality. Both eC and eCeT synergistically upregulated genes related to photosystem II (PsbA) and photosystem I (PsaA/B/C), thereby enhancing photochemical efficiency (ΦPSII by +18% and 12%) through improved electron transport and ATP/NADPH synthesis. This molecular reprogramming, coupled with RBCL-mediated carbon assimilation and NEMDH-facilitated photorespiratory bypass, contributed to a 37% increase in net photosynthetic rate (P<sub>n</sub>) under eC. eT alone activated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) while maintaining ΦPSII stability, supporting continued starch accumulation (+22% NPQ) without diminishing the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. Although eCeT induced more synergistic gene regulation (32 differentially expressed genes vs. 22 under eC + eT), no significant interaction effect on P<sub>n</sub> was observed (p > 0.05), suggesting maintenance of post-transcriptional homeostasis. Ultimately, eC significantly enhanced P<sub>n</sub> and ΦPSII, resulting in a 24% yield increase that was not offset by warming. However, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced carbohydrate accumulation led to reductions in grain protein (-7.2%) and mineral contents (P, K, Mg, Mn), with elevated temperature only partially mitigating mineral losses. The identification of RBCL and NEMDH as key climate-resilience biomarkers, along with PEPC-mediated thermal adaptation, provides promising molecular targets for breeding nutrient-enriched rice cultivars suited to warming, high-latitude environments. These findings indicate that while warming helps sustain the yield benefits of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in cold regions, it exacerbates nutrient dilution, highlighting the need for strategies that jointly optimize both yield and nutritional quality under future climate scenarios.",2025,Chunyu Zhang; Yanfeng Hu; Zhenhua Yu; Jinyuan Zhang; Xiaojing Hu; Junjie Liu; Guanghua Wang; Xiaobing Liu; Jian Jin; Yansheng Li,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB
40966924,"Effects of persistent thermal plumes on Zostera muelleri reproductive effort, seed bank densities and seed bank viability.","A warming climate poses significant threats to seagrass species worldwide, resulting in ecosystem impacts such as reduced foreshore stabilisation, decreased fisheries habitat, and diminished carbon sequestration. The recovery of seagrass is often inconsistent, taking weeks to years, and in severe cases, recovery may not occur. Recovery is facilitated through both asexual and sexual reproduction, with smaller or short-term disturbances typically favoring asexual reproduction, while large-scale disturbances rely on a persistent seed bank. This study investigated reproductive metrics of Zostera muelleri in persistent thermal plumes, measuring reproductive shoot density, spathe counts, and seed bank density and viability. An estuary affected by thermal effluent, Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia, was used as a proxy for future climate scenarios and compared with two other east coast Australian estuaries. Seed banks in all three systems were relatively small (averaging 16 seeds m<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting that these populations may not rely strongly on seed banks for recovery. Mean reproductive shoot densities ranged from 4 to 8 shoots m<sup>-2</sup>, while spathe counts averaged between 10 and 20 per reproductive shoot, with peak reproductive metrics observed in November and January. Importantly, no significant differences in reproductive shoot densities, spathe counts, or seed bank viability were found between thermally affected (mean maximum temperatures ~2 °C higher) and ambient conditions, indicating that Zostera muelleri reproduction on the east coast of Australia may have the capacity to acclimate to temperatures expected by the end of the 21st century.",2025,Tom Moir; Megan J Huggett; Timothy M Smith; Troy F Gaston,Marine pollution bulletin
40966872,"Habitat degradation and quality assessment of Khyargas Lake, Western Mongolia and adjacent terrestrial and freshwater areas.","Lakes in Western Mongolia have international significance as they provide an important stopover for numerous migratory bird species. These wetlands also have a primary role in acting as an ecological regulator for maintaining water regimes and habitats which directly impact the level of biodiversity, ecological functionality and climate change resilience of the surrounding environments. This study evaluates the habitat quality and degradation status over the period of 2002-2022 of Khyargas Lake, the second-largest brackish lake in Mongolia, and its terrestrial and interconnected freshwater surroundings, using the InVEST (Integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs) model. We used satellite images to analyse land cover changes and threat sources, estimating their maximum distance of impact and sensitivity score for each threat source within land cover types. The results indicate that steppe and dry steppe regions are transitioning toward semi-desert conditions, suggesting that the area may be experiencing aridification. By 2022, an estimated 11.1 % of the total study area was identified as exhibiting varying degrees of habitat degradation. We identified a particular risk of habitat quality losses around Khyargas Lake, where most tourism activities are present, and in areas with dry steppe and desert steppe land cover. Identifying areas of varying habitat quality and determining threats can help shape guide conservation and restoration efforts at Khyargas Lake more effectively. This may assist decision-makers in reducing the potential impact of human activities on habitat quality.",2025,Purevsuren Munkhtur; Maartje Oostdijk; David Cook,Journal of environmental management
40966808,Techno-economic assessment and life cycle analysis of a corncob-based xylitol biorefinery.,"A detailed techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of a proposed xylitol biorefinery from corncob biomass was performed. The calculations are based on a plant with 20 t of corncob as the feed. Based on the simulation analysis, the commercial plant was estimated to produce ∼209 t of food-grade xylitol annually. The selling price of xylitol was calculated to be Rs 375/kg of crystals, which would achieve a payback of less than 5 years with a high internal rate of return. The environmental impacts calculated from the plant showed GHG emissions of ∼7.67 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq/kg of the crystals with low water footprint and other ecotoxicities. The electrical and steam utilities involved in different unit operations within the plant were the major contributors towards CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the operating cost. The results illustrated that the plant would have favorable economics and can contribute towards sustainable xylitol production in India.",2025,Diptarka Dasgupta; Prasenjit Ghosh; Vishal Ahuja; Snehal More; Thallada Bhaskar,The Science of the total environment
40966802,A multi-source approach to groundwater storage and recharge assessment in the Volta Basin.,"Assessing groundwater storage changes is important in semiarid regions such as the Volta Basin in sub-Saharan Africa but can be challenging due to data scarcity. This study presents a multi-source approach combining NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission data, Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) precipitation data, the new Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) v2.2 CLSM groundwater storage anomaly dataset, traditional non-groundwater terrestrial water storage components from GLDAS v2.1, and Copernicus satellite data for surface water dynamics to analyze groundwater storage changes and recharge rates in the Volta Basin. Our study reveals: (1) A small change in groundwater storage from 2002 to 2012, followed by a significant increase from 2012 to 2022; (2) A total groundwater increase of approximately 30 cubic kilometers or about 10 cm of liquid water equivalent over the entire study period; (3) Water storage in the basin is dominated by fluctuations in Lake Volta, which accounts for ∼50 % of terrestrial water storage; (4) Groundwater recharge rates estimated using the Water Table Fluctuation Method on GRACE- and GLDAS-derived data, aligned with values from monitoring wells and previous studies; (5) The GLDAS v2.2 dataset exhibits similar seasonal trends with periodic peaks and troughs, yet the amplitude of anomalies from GLDAS are larger compared to the GRACE dataset; and (6) Groundwater recharge shows a weak correlation with extreme precipitation events, suggesting more water percolates rather than evaporates during such events. However, other factors, including land use changes and agricultural practices, may also impact groundwater storage and recharge.",2025,Sergio A Barbosa; Norman L Jones; Gustavious P Williams; Henok Teklu; Sandow M Yidana; Sarva T Pulla; Jorge Luis Sanchez; E James Nelson; Daniel P Ames; A Woodruff Miller,The Science of the total environment
40966538,Critical Role of Land Management Practices in Augmenting China's Terrestrial Carbon Sink up to 2060.,"China's carbon neutrality goal hinges on augmenting its terrestrial carbon sink through land management practices and environmental changes. However, the magnitude of China's future terrestrial carbon sink and its contributing factors remain uncertain. Notably, there is a lack of appropriate tools to parse the contributions of individual land management practices (i.e., afforestation/reforestation, grassland grazing exclusion, and wood extraction) to China's future terrestrial carbon sink. Employing a process-based model, this study projected an increment of 84.8 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup> in China's terrestrial carbon sink for 2021-2060 under the SSP1-2.6 scenario relative to the 2020 baseline of 224.1 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Land management practices, including afforestation and reforestation, reduced wood extraction, and grazing exclusion, were responsible for 96.8% of this increment, while environmental changes accounted for only 3.2% of this increment, with climate change nearly fully offsetting the contribution from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> growth. China's terrestrial carbon sinks were estimated to range from 289.8 to 339.8 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup> during 2021-2060 under different land management practices and environmental conditions. These findings highlight the dominant role of land management practices in augmenting carbon sequestration and provide critical insights for developing climate policies that support China's carbon neutrality goals.",2025,Mengyang Xu; Pengyi Zhang; Junhao He; Chao Yue; Ziyu Zhang; Qi Tian; Feilong Shen; Zhongdian Zhang; Jie Zhao; Mengyu Wang; Lei Zhu; Yi Leng; Jiasheng Li; Lele Wang,Environmental science & technology
40966432,Balancing Cell Growth and Product Synthesis for Efficient Microbial Cell Factories.,"The sustainable, bio-based production of industrially valuable chemicals and materials from renewable, non-edible biomass through biorefineries has emerged as a vital strategy for tackling urgent global challenges, including climate change, and for realizing the ""net zero carbon"" commitments recently pledged by nations worldwide. Metabolic engineering has played a central role in enabling the development of microbial strains capable of efficiently overproducing a diverse array of target compounds. Nevertheless, engineered microbial cell factories often face inherent trade-offs between product synthesis and cell growth, frequently resulting in diminished fitness or loss-of-function phenotypes. This review highlights recent advances in metabolic engineering strategies aims at reconciling this conflict, encompassing pathway optimization, dynamic regulation, orthogonal system design, microbial consortia engineering, fermentation process control, and integrative metabolic modeling. It also explores the remaining challenges and future directions for reprogramming microbial metabolism to harmonize growth with high-level production.",2025,Linxia Liu; Dongqin Ding; Huiying Wang; Xinyi Ren; Sang Yup Lee; Dawei Zhang,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
40966350,More extreme Indian monsoon rainfall in El Niño summers.,"Extreme rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon can be destructive and deadly to the world's third-largest economy and most populous country. Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.",2025,Spencer A Hill; Destiny Zamir Meyers; Adam H Sobel; Michela Biasutti; Mark A Cane; Michael K Tippett; Fiaz Ahmed,"Science (New York, N.Y.)"
40966344,Climate rather than overgrazing explains most rangeland primary productivity change in Mongolia.,"Rangelands are Earth's dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.",2025,Avralt-Od Purevjav; Tumenkhusel Avirmed; Steven W Wilcox; Christopher B Barrett,"Science (New York, N.Y.)"
40966263,"Study protocol for an observational panel study of heat strain in the general adult population in Basse Santa Su, The Gambia.","Heat is among the most hazardous environmental factors for human health, but humidity's role in heat-related health effects remains unclear. This study will assess the effect of humid heat and other environmental conditions on health in a representative population in Basse Santa Su, The Gambia, a region at high risk of humid heat exposure. We will examine the association between humid heat exposure and physiological heat strain, identify vulnerable sub-groups, and evaluate adaptive behaviours. We will recruit 60-90 healthy adults from Basse Santa Su and surrounding areas. Participants will be monitored for four non-consecutive weeks across dry (November-May) and rainy (June-October) seasons. Daily questionnaires will assess activities, thermal comfort, adaptation behaviours, heat strain symptoms, mood, and sleep quality. Wearables will collect time-resolved personal and indoor exposure (temperature and humidity), heat strain, and further physiological covariates. A fixed monitoring network will measure outdoor air temperature, humidity, air quality, and environmental noise. Descriptive analyses will assess baseline characteristics, heat stress and heat strain. Case-time series analysis with distributed non-linear lagged models will estimate immediate and delayed associations between exposure to humid heat and physiological heat strain. Stratified analyses by individual characteristics will explore possible vulnerability groups. Multiple exposure models and interaction terms will explore cumulative effects of multiple environmental factors. Multilinear land use regression modelling will develop high-resolution maps of temperature, humidity, and heat stress. This study will provide new insights into humid heat's effect on health, particularly in low-income, high-exposure settings. This study addresses limitations in prior epidemiological research on heat, humidity, and health, including lack of high-resolution and individual-level data, and limited focus on humidity as a heat-health driver, on non-mortality outcomes and on climate-vulnerable populations. This study combines high-resolution microclimate mapping and individual-level measurements which may inform future epidemiological studies and heat-health interventions.",2025,Elisabeth Tadiri; Apolline Saucy; Ana Bonell; Philip Musa Sarjo; Bakary Sonko; Jonathan Vicente Dos Santos Ferreira; Moritz Burger; Moritz Gubler; Kelton Minor; Ana M Vicedo-Cabrera,PloS one
40966247,Scrub typhus in Nan province (Thailand): Seventeen years of data to understand the impact of land cover change.,"Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted by chigger mites (Leptotrombidium), is a major health problem in northern Thailand, particularly in Nan province. Land cover change, by altering the ecosystem, could affect the ecology of the vector and consequently the risk of scrub typhus transmission. This study investigated the impact of land cover changes on scrub typhus transmission in 2.5 km buffer zones around each village of Nan Province between 2003 and 2019. Using the open land cover data of the European Spatial Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), we quantified land cover composition and land cover changes and integrated public health data on scrub typhus cases, as well as information on elevation, population, and slope. Generalized Additive Models were applied to assess the effects of land cover changes on annual scrub typhus cases. Scrub typhus cases increased significantly during the study period, peaking in 2012 and 2016, mainly in mountainous areas rather than in the Nan River valley. Land cover associated with cases included shrubland, mosaic land, broadleaf forest, and needleleaf forest. Cases increased with shrubland and mosaic land, displayed an inverted U-shaped relationship with broadleaf forest, and decreased with needleleaf forest. Key land cover change factors included shrubland transitions, population, and geographic interactions. Reforestation (from shrubland to broadleaf forest) showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with cases, whereas stable broadleaf forest and loss of shrubland to grassland became non-significant. Male population increased cases. This study highlights the importance of land cover changes in understanding disease transmission and suggests that landscapes disturbance may create optimal conditions for O. tsutsugamushi transmission. This is a novel regional-scale exploration of land cover impacts on scrub typhus in Thailand.",2025,Nolwenn Blache; Karine Chalvet-Monfray; Rawadee Kumlert; Soawapak Hinjoy; Serge Morand,PLoS neglected tropical diseases
40966207,"Climate change, urbanisation and transmission potential: Aedes aegypti mosquito projections forecast future arboviral disease hotspots in Brazil.","Climate change and urban expansion pose significant challenges to controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, a primary vector of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. This study aims assess how climate and anthropogenic factors will jointly shape Ae. aegypti densities in Brazil, which is crucial to forecasting transmission risks and informing public health strategies. This study combined a biologically informed, stage-structured delay-differential equation model with climate and anthropogenic data. Climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were used to forecast future climate scenarios from 2024 to 2080. Boosted Regression Trees integrated anthropogenic factors like urbanisation, population growth, and urban accessibility. Model outputs were validated with entomological surveillance data, and the basic reproductive number for dengue fever was used to assess changes in disease transmission potential. Our findings predicted that Ae. aegypti mosquito density will increase nationally, but unevenly, exceeding thermal limits in North Brazil while rising substantially in the South and Southeast. Increases in density were particularly pronounced under high greenhouse gas emission scenario SSP5-8.5 (up to 92% in the Southeast). These trends were projected to elevate the transmission potential for dengue fever, with Southeast Brazil facing the biggest increases due to mosquito population growth outpacing human population expansion. Validation against historical data confirmed model robustness. By directly linking mosquito abundance to SSP-specific emissions trajectories, our results show that climate mitigation can markedly reduce disease risk. Shifting from SSP5-8.5 to SSP1-2.6 could cut projected mosquito density increases from 31% to 11% nationally by 2080. The model's spatial granularity and integration of local administrative boundaries support its utility for national and sub-national health planning. Addressing compounded risks in vulnerable peri-urban and rural populations will require coordinated interventions that span climate policy, vector control, and health equity.",2025,Katherine Heath; Lincoln Muniz Alves; Michael B Bonsall,PLoS neglected tropical diseases

The purpose of this article is to describe how nursing and other health care education programs acknowledge planetary health on their websites. Nine website metrics were evaluated for top programs across 14 unique health care professions. Seventy university websites were reviewed. Nursing programs are most likely to share information about climate-related courses on their websites, but minimally include other metrics. Inclusion of website metrics for other health care professions varied greatly. Nurses are positioned to be leaders in planetary health. Without clear prioritization from institutions of higher learning, there remains a gap between patient needs and health care professionals' knowledge. Intentionally expressing a commitment to planetary health on websites can attract students who prioritize the issue, increasing the impact nurses and other health care professionals can have on planetary health.",2025,Heide Cygan; Aditi Jarayam; Andrew N Garman; Santosh Basapur,Nurse educator
40966010,Soil Microbiota From Warmer and Drier Grasslands Are More Vulnerable to Drought Stress.,"The stability of soil microbial communities under drought stress is critical for sustaining ecosystem function in a changing climate. However, it remains unclear whether long-term exposure to arid environments strengthens microbial drought resistance through adaptation, or instead diminishes it by reducing diversity and shifting functional redundancy. To address this, we sampled soil microbiota (including bacteria, fungi, and protists) communities along a 3600-km aridity and temperature gradient in Chinese grasslands, and assessed their compositional resistance to experimental drought. We found that microbiota drought resistance decreased with increasing aridity and temperature, particularly for bacteria and protists. This reduced resistance was attributed to declines in taxonomic diversity, larger microbiota body size, and compositional shifts toward oligotrophic taxa in drier regions. These findings suggest that structural shifts in soil communities associated with chronic arid climate may heighten vulnerability to acute drought events, potentially eroding ecosystem resistance as future climate extremes intensify.",2025,Xihang Yang; Yong Zhang; Xinyue Zhang; Yuting Wang; Xiang Liu; Mu Liu; Yao Xiao; Jihua Wu,Global change biology
40965905,Arctic Soil C and N Cycling Are Linked With Microbial Adaptations During Drought.,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of drought events, yet the mechanisms of microbe-mediated soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling under drought are poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm experiment with a Greenlandic soil subjected to five levels of drought, reducing water content from 180% to 15% over the course of 3 weeks followed by rewetting, mimicking a natural drought event. We linked changes in microbial gene expression related to stress response as well as C and N cycling with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil C and N status. Maximum changes in gene expression occurred at intermediate levels of drought (80% water content), characterized by acclimation of microbial physiology to drought conditions, including production of osmolytes as well as cell wall and membrane modifications. This peak in gene expression changes marked a tipping point associated with a pronounced decline in microbial respiration as well as extracellular enzyme activities under more intense drought conditions. Interestingly, C-cycling gene expression correlated with soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> contents. Moreover, N-cycling gene expression correlated with PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> contents and with the activity of laccases. These findings highlight linkages between microbial C, N, and P cycling because of stoichiometric constraints under drought. 24 h after rewetting, we found a shift in microbial expression of C usage genes towards more labile compounds, and an increase in genes related to anabolic activity and signaling, but no signatures of stress responses, suggesting that the microbial community had overcome rewetting-induced changes in osmotic pressure and allocated metabolic activity to growth. Overall, we show that microbial physiological drought responses and microbial resource usage related to C:N:P stoichiometry are key mechanisms of C and N cycling in the Arctic soil under drying and rewetting.",2025,Theis Thomsen; Morten Dencker Schostag; Anders Priemé; Jonathan Donhauser,Global change biology
40965706,Optimization and validation of a linear appraisal system for zoometric traits in dromedary camels.,"Linear appraisal scales focus on the qualitative assessment of specific traits along a standardized scale across animal populations. By minimizing errors and optimizing measurement procedures, these scales streamline resource allocation, saving time and costs for livestock managers and breeders, thereby facilitating informed breeding decisions and promoting genetic progress. A total of 130 adult, healthy dromedary camels (<i>Camelus dromedarius</i>) of the Canarian Camel breed were evaluated across three representative locations in Spain (Huelva, Almería, and Fuerteventura). The study aimed to optimize and validate a linear appraisal system (LAS) for assessing zoometric traits in dromedaries. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that none of the zoometric variables considered were discardable due to their ability to explain variability in the sample. However, some zoometric variables lacked statistically significant representation across one or more levels within the linear appraisal scale. Therefore, a proposal for optimizing the linear appraisal scale involves reducing the number of initially proposed linear categories for these variables. Correlation analysis revealed high internal consistency (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.7), confirming significant agreement between zoometric variability-based scales and linear appraisal traits, thus validating the LAS. Notably, interobserver reliability varied across zoometric traits, with lower agreement (ICC < 0.5) observed in apical body regions, which are more prone to movement during evaluation. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LAS as a robust tool for zoometric evaluation in dromedary camels, aiding in the selection of superior individuals for breeding. In this context, the LAS provides a valuable framework to improve phenotypic characterization of dromedary camels, a livestock species of growing global interest due to its resilience to climate change and its longstanding role as a socio-economic cornerstone in arid and semi-arid production systems.

The soil texture analysis conducted during this study revealed the presence of several soil types with variable quartz content. The basic nature and high electrical conductivity (EC) indicate high amount of dust deposition by the moving traffic, while low content of organic carbon indicate regular road construction can be prevalent in the studied area. The physicochemical characteristics did not affect the trace metal and PAH accumulation pattern. Among the metals studied, Pb pollution was observed to be moderate to high, whereas potential toxicity of PAHs' was significant. Both Chronic Daily Dose (CDD) and Hazard Quotient (HQ) values were higher for Fe especially in children associated with ingestion. Children's total cancer risk (TCR) was low from trace metals and also there was no significant health risk linked to PAHs for either adults or children. Petroleum was shown to be the primary source of PAHs using the Molecular Diagnostic Ratios (MDRs). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted several overlapping sources of trace metals and PAHs, including traffic emissions, industrial activities, and pyrogenic processes, indicating significant anthropogenic impacts.

40965675,The impact of air temperature on mortality in İstanbul.,"Climate change negatively impacts İstanbul as a Mediterranean city. The observed trends of air temperature over the last decades shows an overall increase in air temperature and extreme events. İstanbul is also at an increased risk of heat stress due to the effect of increasing urbanization. Reliable estimates of air temperature's health impacts in İstanbul are needed to understand the relationship between city's climate and health of its residents. This study examined the relationship between ambient temperatures and respiratory, cardiovascular, and total (non-accidental) mortality to reveal the health effects of ambient temperatures between 2007 and 2012 in İstanbul. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) paired with a quasi-Poisson regression was employed to analyze the city-specific lag effects of temperature on mortality. The temperature-mortality associations were modeled using a period of up to 21 days (lag 0-20) to examine the delayed and non-linear effects of cold and hot temperatures after the day of exposure. The findings of this study showed that extreme cold temperatures have the highest relative risk for cardiovascular mortality and extreme hot temperatures have the highest relative risks on respiratory and total mortality. Extreme hot days (above 97.5th percentile) and extreme cold days (below 2.5th percentile) accounted for 1.9 (95% CI [CI], 0-7.5) and 9.0 (95% CI, 3.1-21.0) excess deaths for every 1000 cardiovascular deaths, respectively.",2025,Özkan Çapraz,International journal of biometeorology
40965414,Drought Intensity Shapes Soil Legacy Effects on Grassland Plant and Soil Microbial Communities and Their Responses to Future Drought.,"Drought can have long-lasting legacy effects on terrestrial ecosystems via persistent shifts in soil microbial community structure and function. Yet, the role drought intensity plays in the formation of soil-mediated drought legacies and in determining plant and microbial responses to subsequent droughts is unknown. Here, we evaluate how soil-mediated drought legacies shaped by the intensity of an initial drought event influence plant and microbial communities in the following year and their response to a subsequent experimental drought. We determined these responses in two model grassland communities with contrasting resource acquisition strategies. We found that the intensity of the initial (i.e., past) drought shaped the composition, network structure and functioning of soil microbial communities, with stronger effects on prokaryotes than fungi. Moreover, drought intensity determined soil-mediated legacy effects on plant responses to a subsequent drought: increasing past drought intensity decreased the drought resistance of the slow-strategy plant community and reduced productivity overshoot in the fast-strategy community after re-wetting. Our findings demonstrate that increasing drought intensity can lead to distinct legacies in soil microbial community composition and function with impacts on plant responses to future droughts.",2025,Natalie J Oram; Nadine Praeg; Richard D Bardgett; Fiona Brennan; Tancredi Caruso; Paul Illmer; Johannes Ingrisch; Michael Bahn,Global change biology
40965389,"The Role of Individual, Household, and Neighborhood-Level Factors in Eco-anxiety: Results From a Birth Cohort Study of Portuguese Adolescents.","Eco-anxiety, a growing concern among adolescents in climate-vulnerable regions like Portugal, requires a deeper understanding of its contributing factors to inform effective interventions. This study aimed to identify individual, household, and neighborhood-level factors associated with eco-anxiety among Portuguese adolescents. Data were collected in 2022-2023 from 1,188 participants aged 16-18 years in the Generation XXI birth cohort. Eco-anxiety was assessed using the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale. Using hierarchical regression models, we estimated associations with individual (e.g., gender, mental health), household (e.g., income), and neighbourhood-level variables (e.g., urbanicity, pollution). We analyzed data from 1,188 adolescents (55.8% female; median age: 17.0 years). The median overall eco-anxiety scale was 4.0 (interquartile range: 7.0). Being female was associated with higher odds of scoring at least 1 on the eco-anxiety scale (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-4.23) and increased eco-anxiety scores (rate ratio [RR] = 1.15, 1.01-1.30). Elevated anxiety (RR = 1.02, 1.01-1.02), emotional and behavioral difficulties (OR = 1.10, 1.04-1.16), and engagement with environmental information sources (OR = 2.33, 1.57-3.44), particularly documentaries (RR = 1.26, 1.06-1.51), were linked to higher eco-anxiety. Lower household income was associated with higher eco-anxiety scores (RR = 0.94, 0.90-0.99), while maternal migration status reduced the odds of scoring at least 1 (OR = 0.38, 0.15-0.96). Residing in peri-urban areas reduced the odds of scoring at least 1 in the behavioral dimension compared to urban areas (OR = 0.47, 0.23-0.95). Eco-anxiety was associated with individual and household factors, and to a lesser degree, with neighborhood characteristics, suggesting that a multilayered approach may be useful in addressing this emerging health concern.",2025,Ana Isabel Ribeiro; Inês Morais Vilaça; Ana Henriques; Maria Pastor Valero; Alícia Matijasevich; Milton Severo; Henrique Barros,The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine
40965193,The effect of temperature on phytoplankton physiology: a mesocosm and modeling study.,"Strategies that focus on reducing nutrient loading to freshwater lakes have historically been successful in improving water quality by curbing large phytoplankton blooms. However, as waters warm, little is known about the resultant phytoplankton physiology and ensuing perturbations in the food web that may occur. Here, we designed a mesocosm experiment to investigate the impact of warming water on phytoplankton physiology and further validate a previously developed, coarse-grained model that predicts the key aspects of phytoplankton physiology, including elemental stoichiometry and macromolecular allocation, across varying temperatures. We found that higher temperatures double the maximum cellular density (cells L<sup>-1</sup>) of phytoplankton, suggesting that high temperature stimulates cell division over maximizing carbon storage. Also, the cells in warmer waters dedicate fewer resources to proteins and RNA production, leading to higher fractions of carbon allocated to storage. This work illustrates the potential impact warming waters may have on the ecosystem, as higher fractions of carbohydrates are often associated with less nutritious food for higher trophic levels.IMPORTANCEWe take a novel approach to investigating the impact of warming on phytoplankton physiology by utilizing mesocosms and a coarse-grained cellular model. Previous work in this field tends to use idealized laboratory experiments, mesocosms, or models alone. By synthesizing model and mesocosm results, we test the model's ability to capture physiology in semi-natural environments. We conducted this experiment under phosphorus limitation and saw high cell densities in the heated, treatment tanks. Thus, warming waters may negate some successful management practices that curb eutrophication. With increased temperatures, we also observed increased N:P values in both the experimental and model results, which may be due to the combined effects of a lack of P storage, fewer enzymes required, and a corresponding decrease in RNA production. Our model predictions closely aligned to mesocosm observations, suggesting the capability of our model to represent lower trophic organisms in ecosystem models.",2025,Gabrielle Armin; Gergely Boros; Mariann Kis; Máté Burányi; Hajnalka Horváth; Krisztina Krassován; Takako Masuda; Gábor Bernát; Keisuke Inomura,Microbiology spectrum
40964903,An Integrated Community Disaster and Climate Resilience Model for rural communities in Zimbabwe.,"This study explores the importance of integrating disaster and climate resilience into Zimbabwe's rural communities, resulting ultimately in a model that reflects both their priorities and needs. The Integrated Community Disaster and Climate Resilience Model (ICDCRM) was developed by engaging with community members, traditional leaders, and disaster risk reduction and climate change practitioners using the constructivist grounded theory approach. A total of 33 participants shared views in focus-group discussions and semi-structured interviews-concurrent data collection and analysis were performed with the aid of Atlas.ti (2018) software. This study affirms that disaster and climate resilience strategies can be integrated into at-risk communities to enhance their responses to climate change and disasters. These phenomena pose interlinked risks; hence, strategies to prepare for and respond to them should be coherent and synergistic. The ICDCRM reveals that integrated disaster and climate resilience can create sustainable pathways to effective coordination of strategies and efficient management of risks.",2026,Louis Nyahunda; Livhuwani David Nemakonde; Sizwile Khoza,Disasters

Examples are given from purposefully selected countries to demonstrate the effectiveness of exploring issues through an intersectional approach. The authors conclude that a 'one size fits all' approach, when working towards universal mental health, is not the best approach and cannot provide a solution for all.

40964772,Evidence for size-dependent cardiac oxygen supply in a fish.,"Gill oxygen uptake and cardiac oxygen supply have been proposed as key parameters governing size-dependent environmental resilience in fish. We investigated the allometry of arterial (PaO₂) and venous (PvO₂) oxygen partial pressures in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) across a large body mass range (282-3834 g, n=40) during acute warming (18-25°C), with or without hyperoxia (150% air saturation), and following exhaustive exercise. PaO₂ scaling exponents (b) were not significantly negative during warming, indicating no size-dependent limitation in gill oxygen uptake of resting fish. However, following exhaustive exercise at 25°C, PaO₂ declined significantly with body mass (b=-0.21), suggesting oxygen uptake may become limiting in larger individuals under combined thermal and physical stress. PvO₂ exhibited significant negative scaling with body mass at both 18°C and 25°C (b=-0.34 and -0.37), suggesting lower cardiac oxygen availability in larger fish. Hyperoxia mitigated the mass effect on PvO₂ - disproportionately benefiting larger fish - but loss of equilibrium occurred in several fish following exhaustive exercise regardless of oxygen treatment. The negative scaling of venous oxygenation with size highlights a novel mechanism that may constrain oxygen transport in large fish. Our results emphasize the need to account for size-dependent physiological vulnerability in conservation planning under climate change.",2025,Luis L Kuchenmüller; Andreas Ekström; Elizabeth C Hoots; Michael R Skeeles; Erik Sandblom; Timothy D Clark,The Journal of experimental biology
40964674,Tobacco intercropping enhances soil fertility by improving synergic interactions between soil physicochemical and microbial properties.,"Intercropping tobacco with other crops has been shown to upregulate soil health by fostering synergistic interactions between physicochemical and microbial properties. This study aims to evaluate the impact of intercropping on physicochemical attributes, rhizospheric microbial community, and functional dynamics of soil cultivated with tobacco plants. A field experiment was comprised with five treatments, such as tobacco monoculture (TT), soybean monoculture (SS), maize monoculture (MM), tobacco-soybean intercropping (TS), and tobacco-maize intercropping (TM). Soil nutrients observed, while bacterial and fungal community profiles were assessed through high-throughput sequencing targeting the 16S rDNA and ITS hypervariable regions. Microbial interactions and network resilience were assessed through co-occurrence network analysis. Intercropping significantly improved the soil nutrient properties. Compared with tobacco monoculture (TT), the tobacco-soybean intercropping (TS) treatment enhanced cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) by 13.9, 13.9, 43.8, and 129.1%, respectively. Tobacco-maize intercropping (TM) enhanced CEC (26.7%) and AK (9.7%). Both intercropping models significantly increased bacterial species richness in tobacco soil, whereas fungal diversity was more pronounced under monoculture conditions. Intercropping favored the proliferation of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Basidiomycota,</i> while concurrently suppressing <i>Ascomycota</i>. Tobacco-maize intercropping specifically augmented nitrifying bacteria and <i>Actinobacteria</i>, while tobacco-soybean intercropping predominantly facilitated the recruitment of symbiotic fungi. Intercropping intensified microbial network complexity and modularity, upregulate ecosystem resilience to disturbances. Mantel analysis indicated that the bacterial community structure was primarily influenced by soil pH, whereas fungal communities exhibited strong combinations with available potassium and phosphorus. Intercropping systems substantially improved soil ecological functionality by modulating microbial community composition and nutrient dynamics. Tobacco-maize intercropping reinforced soil ecosystem stability through enrichment of functional microorganisms and optimization of community architecture, while tobacco-soybean intercropping leveraged nitrogen fixation by legumes to augment nitrogen availability and facilitate the establishment of nitrogen-cycling microbes, demonstrating superior efficacy in enhancing soil fertility. These findings suggest that tobacco intercropping can be sustainable agricultural strategy to maintain soil health and productivity in the era of climate change.",2025,Kaiyuan Gu; Xianglu Liu; Ming Liu; Xu Wei; Juan Li; Yanxia Hu; Yonglei Jiang; Yi Chen; Dexun Wang; Yanming Yang; Jiaen Su; Longchang Wang,Frontiers in microbiology
40964626,Vulnerability of a Small Population of an Arboreal Mammal to Landscape Change Associated With a New Motorway and Drought.,"Small populations are vulnerable to extinction due to extrinsic factors such as increasing levels of habitat disturbance and isolation, as well as environmental variation. We investigated the response of a small population of a nationally threatened Australian arboreal mammal, the yellow-bellied glider (<i>Petaurus australis</i>; 560 g), to the construction of a new motorway, which increased isolation of this population. We contrasted the small population with two larger populations in conservation reserves in the broader region. We conducted surveys in 6 of 10 years at 92 sites across the three forest areas to describe changes in population occupancy. A severe drought occurred in year 6 of our study. The probability of occupancy in year 1 was lower (0.22) in the small population compared to the larger reserve populations (0.52). The drought had a profound influence on all populations, with lower detection leading into the drought, before detection recovered to pre-drought levels in the reserves. Additional survey effort using audio-recorders was employed to detect individuals in the small population of this highly vocal species, but none were detected 4 years after the drought, suggesting local extinction had occurred. Whilst motorway construction increased population isolation, it appears the drought was probably the most consequential factor given its adverse influence on all populations. The three forest areas also contained the coastal sugar glider (<i>Petaurus breviceps</i>; 100 g), which has much larger population sizes (~28 times larger in the small population area) and a higher reproductive rate compared to the yellow-bellied glider. Its probability of occupancy (> 0.6) did not differ among the three populations and was unaffected by the drought. The contrasting response in the two species highlights the importance of life history traits when populations are fragmented.",2025,Ross L Goldingay; Brendan D Taylor; Luke Andrews; David Rohweder,Ecology and evolution
40964211,"Economic burden, health burden and predictive analysis of diabetes attributed to non-optimal temperature in global from 1990 to 2030.","This study investigated the impact of epidemiological and demographic Changes on the health and economic burdens of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) attributed to non-optimal temperature. Mortality data were from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, while economic data were sourced from multiple databases. The study analyzed global and regional trends in diabetes deaths, mortality rates, and years of life lost (YLL) due to non-optimal temperatures from 1990 to 2021, considering factors such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), gender, region, and age. The economic impact was assessed using YLL and labor market indicators in the 50 most populous countries. In 2021, 102,872 T2DM deaths globally were attributed to non-optimal temperatures, with low-temperature ASMR 1.61 times higher than high-temperature ASMR. From 1990 to 2021, Age-Standardized Mortality Rate(ASMR) for T2DM attributed to high and low temperatures increased significantly (84.17% and 24.06%) in low-to-middle SDI regions. Older adults had the highest mortality rate, and males faced higher risks than females. ASMR peaked at an SDI of 0.48 and decreased with increasing SDI. From 2022 to 2030, the female ASMR from T2DM attributed to non-optimal temperatures is projected to rise by 26.54% in Pakistan and 42.61% in Nepal. Low temperatures remain a major mortality driver, with elderly males and low-SDI populations most at risk. Targeting young males with preventive measures can reduce future mortality. Countries with large populations and low SDI should prioritize temperature interventions to address climate change.

40964027,Effects of Environmental Agents of Denudation on Wetlands - A Tobit Regression Model Analysis.,"Wetlands are vital ecosystems that play critical roles in biodiversity conservation, water purification, and climate regulation. However, they are increasingly vulnerable to environmental agents of denudation such as erosion, deforestation, and land-use change. Researchers have established the relationship between environmental agents, water-holding bodies, and hydrological cycle. It is imperative to state that this study intends to provide a quantitative comparison. Thus, this study employs a Tobit regression model to examine the effects of these agents on wetland size, using data from 51,885 observations and accounting for the censored nature of the wetland extent variable (Wetlevel). The model results indicate that several environmental factors significantly affect wetland size. Specifically, vegetation cover, soil moisture, and conservation efforts (erosion severity, conservation program presence, land cover heterogeneity) are positively associated with larger wetlands, while deforestation (deforestation rate) and erosion index exhibit strong negative association. Notably, erosion index had one of the most substantial negative coefficients (-0.00100, p < 0.01), confirming it is a major driver of wetland loss. The model also found that climatic variables (rainfall, temperature variability, elevation, distance to urban center) and socio-economic indicators (farming intensity, population density, land use pressure index) significantly influence wetland dynamics. The Tobit model's fit statistics (AIC/N = 2.689; ANOVA-based fit = 0.0159) affirm its suitability for modeling censored ecological data. These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated environmental management strategies targeting erosion control, forest conservation, and sustainable land use to protect and restore wetlands.",2025,Abass Adeniyi Gazal; Carol J Miller,Research square
40963846,"Projected Distributions of Two Key Vectors of Lumpy Skin Disease, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>, Under Climate Change.","Lumpy skin disease (LSD), a severe transboundary disease of cattle, has caused substantial economic losses worldwide. Its transmission involves multiple vector species, among which <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i> are recognized as important contributors due to their broad distribution and ecological adaptability. Modeling the global distribution of the two key vectors is essential for anticipating their potential range expansion under climate change, thereby providing a scientific basis for developing targeted surveillance and control strategies for LSD. Our ensemble models revealed distinct environmental drivers and distributional responses for <i>A. aegypti</i> and <i>S. calcitrans</i>. The distribution of <i>A. aegypti</i> was predicted to be primarily influenced by urban land cover as well as temperature-related variables, especially the mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio8) and the mean temperature of the driest quarter (Bio9). In contrast, <i>S. calcitrans</i> was strongly driven by managed pasture coverage and precipitation seasonality, indicating its reliance on livestock-associated habitats and stable moisture conditions. Under future climate scenarios, <i>A. aegypti</i> showed a pronounced potential for expansion into higher latitudes, while <i>S. calcitrans</i> exhibited range shifts toward temperate regions. Taking the 2050s (SSP1-2.6) as an example, the percentage gain for <i>A. aegypti</i> reached 96.2%, while for <i>S. calcitrans</i>, the percentage gain reached 43.98%. Our findings highlight the importance of multiple vector assessments in predicting LSD risk under climate change. Distinct habitat shifts of <i>A. aegypti</i> and <i>S. calcitrans</i> indicate the need for differentiated control strategies in different regions.",2025,Li Li; Zhulin Zhang; Haoyu Ran; Mingwei Xing; Boyang Liu,Transboundary and emerging diseases
40963829,Applications of CRISPR/Cas tools in improving stress tolerance in <i>Brassica</i> crops.,"<i>Brassica</i> species, which include economically important <i>Brassica</i> crops grown around the globe, are important as popular vegetables, forage, and oilseed crops, supplying food for humans and animals. Despite their importance, these crops face increasing challenges from biotic and abiotic stresses, exacerbated by climate change and the evolving threat of crop pathogens. Enhancing crop resilience against these stresses has become a key priority to ensure stable crop production. Recent advancements in genomic studies on <i>Brassica</i> crops and their pathogens have facilitated the deployment of CRISPR/Cas systems in breeding major <i>Brassica</i> crops. This review highlights recent progress in CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing technologies to improve resistance to pathogens and enhance tolerance to drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures. It also summarises the molecular mechanisms underlying crop responses to these stresses. Furthermore, the review discusses the workflow for employing the CRISPR/Cas system to boost stress tolerance and resistance, outlines the associated challenges, and explores prospects based on gene editing research in <i>Brassica</i> species.",2025,Linh Bao Ton; Zuhra Qayyum; Junrey Amas; William J W Thomas; David Edwards; Jacqueline Batley; Aria Dolatabadian,Frontiers in plant science
40963819,Brassinosteroid preharvest treatments as a useful tool to increase crop yield and red colour in blood orange fruits.,"Blood oranges are highly appreciated by consumers due to their attractive peel, red-colour juice, and their antioxidant and other health-beneficial properties. However, increased temperatures due to climate change compromise anthocyanin biosynthesis, depreciating their market value. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones with important effects in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. The present experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of tree foliar treatments with different 24-epibrassinolide (24-BL) concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM) on crop yield and fruit quality properties of the ""Sanguinelli"" blood oranges, with special emphasis on anthocyanin content in the peel and juice. The results of 2-year experiments (2021-2022 and 2022-2023, carried out in Alicante, Spain) showed that 24-BL treatments improved total crop yield. Fruit quality properties, such as firmness, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity, were also enhanced, as well as red colour in the flavedo and juice, due to enhanced total and individual anthocyanin concentrations. The greatest improvements were recorded at the 0.1-μM 24-BL treatment, in which the enhanced peel colour led to a 41% increase in the yield of commercial fruits compared to control trees, which could have an important beneficial impact on growers' profit. In addition, the consumer acceptance of 24-BL could increase since the red colour in blood oranges is the most important parameter valued by consumers. With the enhancement of their total anthocyanin and phenolic contents, their health-beneficial effects are also increased.",2025,Fernando Garrido-Auñón; Jenifer Puente-Moreno; María E García-Pastor; Pedro J Zapata; Domingo Martínez-Romero; María Serrano; Daniel Valero,Frontiers in plant science

40963426,Multifunctional NAC transcription factor SlJA2L integrates the ethylene pathway to orchestrate thermotolerance and fruit ripening in tomato.,"High temperatures driven by climate change are increasingly limiting crop growth and quality. Fruit ripening is a genetically programmed process regulated by transcription factors (TFs), while the phytohormone ethylene plays key roles in both ripening and abiotic stress responses. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. We identified Solanum lycopersicum jasmonic acid 2-like (SlJA2L), a tomato NAC TF that is transcriptionally responsive to both heat stress (HS) and fruit ripening, suggesting that it acts as a molecular integrator of HS adaptation and fruit developmental processes. Overexpression of SlJA2L enhanced heat tolerance and promoted fruit ripening, whereas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9)-mediated knockout led to heat sensitivity and ripening delay. Mechanistically, SlJA2L directly activates SlHsfA3 and SlCAT3 under HS. During ripening, it promotes ethylene biosynthesis via the SlJA2L-SlACO1 module and enhances carotenoid accumulation by activating SlCRTISO. Moreover, ethylene was shown to contribute to thermotolerance, as exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid improved heat tolerance, while silencing SlACO1 reduced it. Our findings demonstrate that SlJA2L integrates ethylene signaling to regulate both thermotolerance and fruit ripening in tomato. This study provides new insights into the molecular coordination of stress responses and developmental transitions, offering a potential strategy for improving crop resilience and fruit ripening under climate stress.",2025,Yunfei Liang; Fang Ma; Shudi Huang; Chao Ma; Hongyan Shi; Fanyi Meng; Yinglu Chen; Han Dong; Rugang Chen; Xiangqiang Zhan,The New phytologist
40963355,Measuring the socio-economic and environmental outcomes of regenerative agriculture across spatio-temporal scales.,"Regenerative agriculture aims to produce food while simultaneously improving soil health, supporting biodiversity, reducing input costs and enhancing climate resilience. Evidence on its environmental and socio-economic impacts across different systems and climates remains limited, with few studies measuring multiple outcomes following whole farming system transition. To be impactful, regenerative agriculture research must address farmers' knowledge needs and provide practically feasible, economically viable solutions. This can be achieved through action-based research, co-designed with farmer stakeholders in real-world settings. Such research is time-consuming and involves potential risk for farmers adopting new practice combinations. Here, we describe two UK research projects gathering evidence on regenerative agriculture in partnership with farmers, at different scales. One is a replicated large-plot trial that stacks regenerative principles, the other a farmer-led quasi-experiment, following the transition in active farm businesses and using a flexible scoring system based on regenerative principles. We highlight benefits, challenges and future research directions emerging from these projects, including: challenges defining regenerative agriculture; co-design and maximizing knowledge exchange; generalizing results beyond study sites, when practices and outcomes are context-dependent; the need for interdisciplinarity; and generating evidence on long-term transitions with time lags between system change and outcomes, in an environment of short-term funding.This article is part of the theme issue 'Transforming terrestrial food systems for human and planetary health'.",2025,Katherine Berthon; Ruth Wade; Pippa Chapman; Coline C Jaworski; Jonathan R Leake; Niamh McHugh; Lisa Collins; Tim Daniell; Yu Zhao; Penelope Watt; Bob Doherty; Peter Jackson; Lynn V Dicks,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
